            <h3>Description</h3>
            The goal of this course is to explore <i>how to assess</i>
            the technology and practices that aim to enhance <i>computer


              security and privacy</i>. A key theme of the course is to
            understand how to measure whether security and privacy goals
            have been achieved. We will learn about promising work in
            this area, including relevant measurement and data analysis
            techniques. In studying it we aim to surface gaps and find
            opportunities to do better.<br>
            <br>
            This is a seminar course. Our main activity will be to read
            and discuss papers from the research literature, as well as
            blog posts, whitepapers, and the occasional textbook
            chapter. Students will be expected to read 1-2 papers per
            class and to submit a short review on each paper prior to
            class, to set the table for discussion.<br>
            <br>
            Students will also have the opportunity to present papers to
            the class (how many depends in part on the class size), and
            receive feedback. We will also have guest lectures from
            experts in the field. The culmination of the course's work
            will be a deep-dive, final project.<br>
            <h3> Prerequisites </h3>
            There are no specific course prerequisites for this course,
            but participants are expected to have a technical background
            in computer science or a related field. Knowledge of
            computer security is a benefit, but is not required.
            Permission to enroll is granted by the instructor (as per
            usual with CIS 7000-level courses).<br>
            <h3>List of topics (tentative)</h3>
            This course covers a variety of topics, aiming to explore
            the following questions (among others):<br>
            <ul>
              <li>In what ways is cybersecurity (not) an empirical
                science?</li>
              <li>How can we view cybersecurity from an economic
                perspective, e.g., as a matter of reducing risk (or
                failing to)?</li>
              <li>What experiments, and experimental methods, can
                measure aspects of security? What are some measurement
                pitfalls?</li>
              <li>Humans affect, or are affected by, security in many
                ways, such as when they act as end users,
                software/system developers, and operators: How can we
                measure or otherwise assess these effects?</li>
            </ul>
            <meta charset="utf-8">
            <meta charset="utf-8">
            Our exploration will lead us to dig into the following
            topics (as well as others TBD!):<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Economic view of cybersecurity</li>
              <li>End users and cybersecurity</li>
              <li>Cybersecurity as a scientific pursuit</li>
              <li>Cybersecurity investment as risk assessment</li>
              <li>Cybersecurity game theory</li>
              <li>Cyberattack economics</li>
              <li>Cybersecurity public health</li>
              <li>Developers' and operators' actions, and security</li>
              <li>Ethics in computer security experimentation</li>
              <li>Network-based security measurement</li>
              <li>Definitions of privacy, and how to assess them<br>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Grading</h3>
            The final grade will consist of two main parts:<br>
            <br>
            <b>Class participation (55%)</b>. This consists of<br>
            <ol>
              <li>(20%) a written 2-3 paragraph <b>review for each
                  paper we read</b>, due prior to the discussion date;</li>
              <li>(14%) <b>participation</b> during class;<br>
              </li>
              <li>(20%) a <b>presentation</b> the student will give
                about a particular topic; and <br>
              </li>
              <li>(1%) a one-on-one meeting with the course instructor<br>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <b>Final project (45%)</b>. The grade consists of<br>
            <ol>
              <li>(30%) project <b>report</b></li>
              <li>(15%) project <b>presentation</b></li>
            </ol>
            <h3><b>Class activities</b></h3>
            <h4>Paper reviews<br>
            </h4>
            For most papers that we read in the class, students must
            submit a <b>review of each paper.&nbsp; </b>These will be
            used to drive discussion of the paper during class -- we
            cannot discuss what we do not read! Each review should
            consist of two parts: (1) a paragraph with key takeaways
            gleaned from the paper; (2) a few questions on topics that
            merit deep-dive discussion, or clarification. Note that part
            (1) should almost certainly not be complete (i.e., not an
            at-a-distance summary) but rather should be used to set up
            sufficient context and justification for the questions in
            part (2). Doing so ensures the questions are not
            surface-level, but rather are thought-through and engaging.
            You are writing a review, which means I want to see your
            opinion and your evidence for it. <b>Reviews are due 3pm
              the day before the class</b>, to avoid a late penalty of
            20%. Reviews are <b>graded on a score of 1-5</b>, where <br>
            <ul>
              <li>0: missing or showing no evidence of having read the
                paper</li>
              <li>1-3: minimal effort or non-insightful summary (anybody
                can copy an abstract)</li>
              <li>4: insightful, but not particularly crisp or incisive;
                oftentimes too long</li>
              <li>5: actively insightful, with interesting and
                well-sourced discussion points (it often takes&nbsp;
                students a couple stabs at it to get to consistent 5's)</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Participating and presenting in class</h4>
            There is an expectation to <b>attend class and participate
              in discussions</b>. The participation score will be based
            in large part on attendance (which we will start noting
            during the second week), but also on the instructor's
            assessment of the thoughtfulness and insight of comments
            made during class.<br>
            <br>
            Each student will be expected to <b>present a paper and
              lead a discussion about it.</b> The presentation should be
            about 25-30 minutes, with the ensuring discussion about 15
            minutes. The goal is to learn to deep-dive into a relevant
            topic, and develop good presentation skills. Doing well will
            require reading your paper(s) early and to be sure you fully
            understand them. Consider practicing your presentation
            beforehand.<br>
            <br>
            Presentations will be judged based on the following
            criteria:<br>
            <ul>
              <li><b>understanding</b>: does the presenter understand
                the material?</li>
              <li><b>thoughtfulness</b>: does the presenter have
                insights and opinions beyond what was in the paper?</li>
              <li><b>background/perspective</b>: did the presenter read
                background papers?</li>
              <li><b>clarity</b>: can the audience understand the
                presentation? is the "big picture" clear? are there
                useful examples?</li>
              <li><b>materials</b>: do the slides or use of blackboard
                illustrate and support the talk? are there diagrams to
                help convey the technicalities? (when your talk gets
                into deep territory, a diagram is worth 10K words)</li>
              <li><b>delivery</b>: has the the presenter practiced?</li>
              <li><b>non-regurgitation</b>: did the presenter do
                something beyond simply typing sections of the paper as
                bullet points? did the presenter motivate the ideas in
                their own words or just state ideas from the paper
                verbatim?</li>
              <li><b>answering questions</b>: can the presenter handle
                questions from the audience?</li>
            </ul>
            Remember that you will likely be able to explain more detail
            than you can hope to cover in a single lecture. This is one
            reason that it's hard work to prepare a good presentation:
            not only do you need to understand the paper, but you need
            to filter out the irrelevant details and amplify the key
            arguments. You'll probably have omit entire sections of the
            paper from your talk -- don't worry about it. Simply
            mimicking the structure of the paper ("regurgitating it")
            tends to produce a disconnected sequence of boring facts. A
            good talk should tell a story; every idea should be
            motivated, and all facts should fit together in a coherent
            picture. Telling such a story in a short time often requires
            creating your own explanations, motivation, and examples. <br>
            <h4><a name="Projects"></a>Projects</h4>
            Each student will propose a project idea roughly 1/3 of the
            way through the semester, to be finalized 1/2 of the way
            through, and then completed by the end of the semester.
            Students may work alone, or in groups of 2 or 3 (with a
            greater expectation on the result).<br>
            <h5>Project ideas</h5>
            Here are a few ideas for project types:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>(1 person project) Deep <i>literature-based
                  exploration of a particular area</i>, e.g., a cogent
                summarization of 10 or more technical papers, possibly
                augmented with experience using tools, etc.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Related: A <i>proposal for new research</i>.
                  Basically, summarize a bunch of prior work, and the
                  gaps it exposes, and sketch the work you would like to
                  see done that could fill those gaps.<br>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li><i>Reproduction, or extension, of a study</i> we have
                read about (or one in another paper we haven't read).
                (2-4 people depending on scope)</li>
              <li><i>Empirical study of some phenomenon</i>, e.g., a
                survey of humans or an examination (and/or construction
                of a data set) + data analysis (2-3 people depending on
                scope)</li>
              <li><i>Risk management-style model</i> for a particular
                phenomenon, informed by realistic datasets (1-2 people
                depending on scope)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>One thing to think about is publishing the results in a
              peer-reviewed venue. For that to be possible, it might be
              that you aim to do part of the work for this class, and
              then finish it next semester. So you need to scope the two
              parts. If you are working with humans, we might need to
              get IRB approval before you can do that.<br>
            </p>
            <h5>Project Proposals</h5>
            <p>In class, each student (or student teams) will present a
              <b>project pitch</b>. This is a 5 minute presentation
              motivating the problem they would like to explore, and a
              sketch of what work they would do to explore it. The goal
              is to get feedback on ideas from the rest of the class,
              and to nail down the work to be done. Students/teams can
              pitch up to two projects, if they want advice to choose
              between them.<br>
            </p>
            <p>A couple of weeks after the pitch, teams will turn in a <b>project
                proposal</b>, which formalizes what they will do. It
              should recap the motivation from the pitch, and include
              the timeline and deliverables for the project. It should
              also mention risks toward completing the project. Total length should be around 3 pages.<br>
            </p>
            <h5>Deliverables</h5>
            The <b> project report</b> will be graded by content -- how
            insightful, useful, and complete is the work covered -- as
            well as adherence to format and content guidelines from the
            class, including, for example, whether the introduction
            answers key questions about the motivation for the project,
            whether the results section provides and interprets a key
            result, whether the related work section distinguishes
            current effort from prior work, and so on. <br>
            <br>
            The <b>project presentation</b>, like the report, will be
            scored based on format and content matching guidelines given
            in class (one of the things you'll be learning is what it
            means to give a good talk, write a good report, and so on).
            Presentations should be about 20 minutes long, with 5
            minutes for questions.<br>
            <br>
            The project report will be due 11:59:59pm EST of the day
            given in the project description for full credit. Project
            reports (and code, if relevant) may be submitted up to 24
            hours late for a 10% penalty. (For example, a project that
            would have earned 90 points for an on-time submission will
            earn 81, that is, 90 times 0.90.) If you submit both on-time
            &amp; late, your project will received the maximum of the
            penalty-adjusted scores.<b><br>
            </b>
            <h4><b>Meet the professor</b></h4>
            <b></b>At least one time during the semester, you get a
            "free" 1% to <b>meet with me at an arranged time</b>. It
            doesn't have to be for class/project help: we can chat about
            research, future plans, whatever!
            <!--And if you mention that you read this hidden comment then you'll get a high-five--><br>
            <h3>Excused absences</h3>
            You are not required to come to class, but not coming will
            affect your class participation grade. There are several
            justifications for <b>excused</b> absences from class:
            illness, religious observation, participation in required
            university activities, or a family or personal emergency. We
            will work with you to make sure that you have a fair amount
            of time to make up for excused absences. The best way that
            we can help is if we know about absences as well in advance
            as possible.
            <ul>
              <li>Provide a request for absence in writing. </li>
              <li>Provide appropriate documentation that shows the
                absence qualifies as excused. </li>
              <li>Provide as much advance notice as is possible, safe,
                and appropriate. </li>
            </ul>
            <p> One self-signed note is permitted, during the semester.<br>
            </p>
            <p> The policies for excused absences <i>do not</i> apply
              to project assignments. Projects will be assigned with
              sufficient time to be completed by students who have a
              reasonable understanding of the necessary material and
              begin promptly. In cases of <i>extremely serious</i>
              documented illness of <i>lengthy duration</i> or other
              protracted, severe emergency situations, the instructor
              may consider extensions on project assignments, depending
              upon the specific circumstances. </p>
            <p> Besides the policies in this syllabus, the University's
              policies apply during the semester.<br>
            </p>
            <h3>Right to change information</h3>
            Although every effort has been made to be complete and
            accurate, unforeseen circumstances arising during the
            semester could require the adjustment of any material given
            here. Consequently, given due notice to students, the
            instructor reserves the right to change any information on
            this syllabus or in other course materials. </div>
