    <h1>Week 5: Automated Reasoning for Code Security</h1>
    Last week we looked at how security fits into the various activities
    of the development process. Up to this point we have generally
    looked at particular software flaws and bugs and how to avoid them
    through good design and implementation practices.<br>
    <br>
    This week we will look at the testing and validation phases of
    software development, and in particular how automated reasoning
    tools can assist developers and testers in finding important
    security bugs. We will focus on two technologies: <i>static
      analysis</i> and <i>symbolic execution</i>.<br>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    After the completion of this week's material, you will:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Know what static analysis (SA) and symbolic execution (SE)
        are, how they compare, and why they are hard</li>
      <li>Understand the basics of each approach</li>
      <li>Understand how to improve the precision and scalability of
        each approach</li>
      <li>Be aware of several commercial and open-source SA and SE
        tools, and how they compare</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Video Lectures</h2>
    This week we cover two code analysis technologies: static analysis,
    and symbolic execution. The latter is often used as the core of a
    penetration testing technology called <i>whitebox</i> fuzz testing;
    we will discuss other fuzz testing techniques next week.<br>

    <h3>Break out: Interview with Andy Chou</h3>
    In August 2014, Mike had the pleasure of interviewing <a

      href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/andy-chou/0/88/149">Andy Chou</a>.
    In 2003, Andy co-founded Coverity, a company that developed static
    analysis (and other) tools for finding software defects. <a

      by SynopSys in 2014</a>. In this interview we discussed principles
    and practice of static analysis, and the path towards making a
    practical tool that is now in wide use. Like last week, the
    interview is optional from an assessment perspective -- there will
    no quiz questions on it. We hope you find it interesting!<br>
