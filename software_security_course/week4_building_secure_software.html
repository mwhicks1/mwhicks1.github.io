    <h1>Week 4: Building Secure Software</h1>
    Most of our time so far has been spent focusing on
    implementation-level issues---<i>bugs</i> that constitute
    vulnerabilities, and means of avoiding those bugs, mitigating them,
    or recovering from them. But we must also be concerned about <i>flaws</i>,
    which are security problems in a software system's design.<br>
    <br>
    To address both flaws and bugs effectively, we need to consider
    security through the entire development process. In this unit, we
    will step back and look at what that entails, taking on the goal of
    <i>building security in</i>.<br>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    After the completion of this week's material, you will be able to:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Identify how security-minded thinking, or security
        engineering, is integrated into the software development process</li>
      <li>Enumerate a series of design principles for writing secure
        software</li>
      <li>Explain how such principles can be violated, pointing to
        actual incidents</li>
      <li>Put these principles into practice by drawing inspiration from
        well-designed, secure systems</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Break out: Interview with Gary McGraw</h3>
    In August 2014, Mike had the pleasure of interviewing <a
      moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://www.garymcgraw.com/">Gary
      McGraw</a>. Gary is a celebrated author and authority on software
    security, which he practiced professionally as the CTO of <a

href="https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/synopsys-acquires-cigital-codiscope/">Cigital,


      Inc. until they were acquired by SynopSys in 2016</a>. In this
    interview we discussed many things relevant to this week's topic of
    secure design and secure development. The interview is optional from
    an assessment perspective -- there will no quiz questions on it (but
    note it may help cement topics in the lectures). We hope you find it
    interesting!<br>
