    <h1>Week 6: Penetration Testing and Fuzz Testing</h1>
    Last week we looked at how automated tools could be used to assist
    developers and testers in finding important security bugs. We
    focused in particular on <i>static analysis</i> and <i>symbolic
      execution</i> as technologies.<br>
    <br>
    This week, we look at the broader practice of <i>penetration
      testing</i> of which tools using these technologies form some
    part, but other practices and techniques are of interest too. We
    will focus in particular on <i>fuzz testing</i>, a technique that
    attempts to find potentially security-relevant software failures.<br>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    After the completion of this week's material, you will:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand what penetration testing is and what it achieves</li>
      <li>Know the basics of several state-of-the-art penetration
        testing tools</li>
      <li>Understand fuzz testing techniques and how they compare</li>
      <li>Be aware of several state-of-the-art fuzz testing tools</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Break out: Interview with Eric Eames</h3>
    In September 2014, Mike interviewed <a moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/eric-eames/68/7b/590">Eric Eames</a>,
    at the time a Principal Security Consultant at FusionX. In this
    interview we discussed principles and practice of penetration
    testing. <b>The interview is <i>required</i></b> from an
    assessment perspective -- some quiz material will be drawn from this
    interview's content.<br>

    <h3>Break out: Interview with Patrice Godefroid</h3>
    In September 2014, Mike had the pleasure of interviewing <a
      moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/pg/">Patrice
      Godefroid</a>, who is a Partner Researcher at Microsoft Research.
    In this interview we discussed principles and practice of fuzz
    testing in general, and whitebox fuzz testing in particular,
    especially as it has come to be used within Microsoft. The interview
    is <i>optional</i> from an assessment perspective, but recommended
    -- there will no quiz questions on it per se, but it might help
    provide context about material from last week and this week.<br>
