    <h1>Project 2: BadStore</h1>
    For this project, we will be using the BadStore.net VM, developed by
    Kurt Roemer and used with permission (thanks, Kurt!). It contains a
    vulnerable web application. Your job will be to exploit
    vulnerabilities we have talked about in the lectures, and answer
    some questions in the <a moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="assets/week3_badstore_quiz.docx">on-line assessment</a> to
    show what you find.<br>
    <br>
    You can use any web browser to interact with BadStore.net, but we
    recommend (and will support) using <a moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>
    (which is freely available). The reason is that Firefox has a nice
    set of <a moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools">developer
      tools</a> that allow you to inspect, and modify, the contents of
    web pages, which will be useful when crafting attacks. If you choose
    to use another browser, then you will have to figure out how/whether
    it will permit the same interactions.<br>
    <h2>Set up and start BadStore with Virtual Box</h2>
    The first step is to set up BadStore on your machine and get it
    running.<br>
    <br>
    BadStore is a Linux-based server application. It is distributed as a
    bootable ISO, which you can download from <a moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="assets/BadStore_212.iso">here</a>. You may also want to
    download the <a moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="assets/BadStore_net_v2_1_Manual.pdf">BadStore manual</a>,
    which describes the design and setup of BadStore in detail.<br>
    <br>
    The BadStore ISO can be booted directly, or run using a Virtual
    Machine Manager, like VMWare or Virtual Box. We will explain how to
    set it up using Virtual Box.<br>
    <br>
    The first step is to install Virtual Box; this project has been
    tested with the most recent version, 4.3.18. There are specific
    instructions for installing VirtualBox for computers running <a
      moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html#installation_windows">Windows</a>,
    <a moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html#install-linux-host">Linux</a>,
    and Mac <a moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html#idp52693904">OSX</a>.<br>
    <br>
    Now we need to create and configure a Virtual Machine to run
    BadStore. Do this using the following steps.<br>
    <h3>1. Create a new VirtualBox VM.</h3>
    Detailed instructions for doing this are <a moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html#gui-createvm">here</a>.
    In short: when you start Virtual Box, click the "New" icon to create
    a new VM. Give your VM the name BadStore; specify the operating
    system type as Linux; and choose 32-bit Ubuntu. You can allocate 512
    MB (or more) RAM to your VM, and specify that it should create the
    hard-drive now. You will be asked how the image should be stored;
    make it a VDI with 8 GB (the default), and this part is important:
    make sure the "Dynamically allocated" radio button is set, so that
    Virtual Box will not reserve the 8 GB on your hard drive, but will
    allocate it on the fly. In fact, we will use none of this space, so
    there's no sense in reserving it in advance.<br>
    <h3>2. Assign the BadStore ISO to the CD-ROM drive of the VM.</h3>
    Detailed instructions are <a moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch03.html#settings-storage">here</a>.
    In short, you should select the Settings for the VM you just
    created, and then select the Storage tab. On the left you will see
    the VM's "Storage Tree" and you should see Controller: IDE as one
    listed. With this selected, add a new controller to this tree by
    clicking the little icon at the bottom with the plus on it in the
    lower left. It will ask you to choose whether to add CD/DVD or a
    Hard Disk; select CD/DVD. Then it will ask you whether to "Choose
    Disk" or "Leave Empty"; select "Choose Disk". A file dialog will
    come up and you should choose the BadStore_212.iso file that you
    previously downloaded. Once you do, you should see this image added
    below the IDE controller in the Storage Tree, and it should be the
    IDE Primary Master. You might also see an entry for "Empty" which
    was there at the start; if so, then remove it by selecting the Empty
    entry and clicking the icon with the minus sign on it.<br>
    <h3>3. Create a HostOnly virtual network.</h3>
    You will need to configure a HostOnly networking for your VM. You
    need to do this in two steps. The first is to create the HostOnly
    network. The next step is to associate that network with your VM.<br>
    <br>
    Details for creating a host-only network are in the VirtualBox <a
      moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#network_hostonly">manual</a>.
    First, you must go to the network settings. For Linux or Windows,
    this will be under "File" -&gt; "Preferences" -&gt; "Network". For
    Mac OS, the settings are under "VirtualBox" -&gt; "Preferences".
    Select the Network tab. You will be shown a list of possible
    networks, including NAT networks, and Host-only Networks. Select
    Host-only networks, and then click the icon on the right to add one.
    It will add an entry with a name like vboxnet0.<br>
    <br>
    If you cannot create a host-only network, it may be because the
    virtualbox kernel drivers are not properly loaded; cf. this <a
      moz-do-not-send="true"
href="http://www.gokhanatil.com/2013/03/virtualbox-failed-to-create-host-only-network-interface-on-ubuntu-linux.html">blog

      post</a>. On MacOS, this problem can be fixed by doing
    <div style="color: #000000;background-color: #fffffe;font-family: Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace;font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;line-height: 18px;white-space: pre;"><div><span style="color: #008080;"><br>sudo</span><span style="color: #000000;"> /Library/StartupItems/VirtualBox/VirtualBox </span><span style="color: #008080;">restart</span></div></div>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <br>
    Select the newly created network entry and edit it by clicking the
    appropriate icon to the right. There are two panes, one for Adapter,
    the other for DHCP Server. The Adapter pane will give the IP address
    for the network, etc. I should be something like 192.168.56.1 with a
    Subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. The DHCP Server pane will show the
    DHCP server information. If it is not enabled with the information
    filled in, then enable it and fill it in as follows:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="color: #000000;background-color: #fffffe;font-family: Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace;font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;line-height: 18px;white-space: pre;"><div><span style="color: #008080;">Server</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #008080;">Address</span><span style="color: #000000;">: </span><span style="color: #098658;">192.168</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span><span style="color: #098658;">56.2</span></div><div><span style="color: #008080;">Server</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #008080;">Mask</span><span style="color: #000000;">: </span><span style="color: #098658;">255.255</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span><span style="color: #098658;">255.0</span></div><div><span style="color: #008080;">Lower</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #008080;">Address</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #008080;">Bound</span><span style="color: #000000;">: </span><span style="color: #098658;">192.168</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span><span style="color: #098658;">56.110</span></div><div><span style="color: #008080;">Upper</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #008080;">Address</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #008080;">Bound</span><span style="color: #000000;">: </span><span style="color: #098658;">192.168</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span><span style="color: #098658;">56.200</span></div></div>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <br>
    Notice that the server address is the same as the adapter address,
    but with 2, rather than 1. Do the same on your own machine. Likewise
    select the address range as 110 to 200, but using the same first
    three octets of the adapter address.<br>
    <h3>4. Assign the BadStore VM to the HostOnly network.</h3>
    Now that you have created the HostOnly network, go back to the
    settings window for the BadStore VM and select the Network pane.
    Select "Host-only adapter" from the "Attached to" drop down. Select
    "vboxnet0" (or whatever it was from step 3) for Name.<br>
    <h3>5. Boot the BadStore VM.</h3>
    Now you are ready to boot your VM. Start the VM by clicking the
    green arrow for Start on the VirtualBox console. You will see a text
    window show up and a bunch of text fly by, while it's booting. (Note
    that, during this time, VirtualBox may "capture" your mouse pointer
    and keyboard and you will have to <a moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html#keyb_mouse_normal">press

      the host key to get them back</a>.) Eventually, the messages
    should get to a point where you see<br>
    <br>
    <div style="color: #000000;background-color: #fffffe;font-family: Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace;font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;line-height: 18px;white-space: pre;"><div><span style="color: #000000;">netcfg: </span><span style="color: #008080;">No</span><span style="color: #000000;"> such file or directory</span></div><div><span style="color: #008080;">Starting</span><span style="color: #000000;"> syslogd</span></div><div><span style="color: #008080;">Bringing</span><span style="color: #000000;"> down eth0</span></div><div><span style="color: #008080;">Found</span><span style="color: #000000;"> configs </span><span style="color: #0000ff;">for</span><span style="color: #000000;">: eth0</span></div><div><span style="color: #008080;">Configuring</span><span style="color: #000000;"> eth0: using </span><span style="color: #008080;">DHCP</span></div><div><span style="color: #000000;">e1000: eth0 </span><span style="color: #008080;">NIC</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #008080;">Link</span><span style="color: #000000;"> is </span><span style="color: #008080;">Up</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #098658;">1000</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #008080;">Mbps</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #008080;">Full</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #008080;">Duplex</span></div></div>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <br>
    At this point, it will hang for a while, for some reason related to
    DHCP, but we aren't sure what. Within a couple of minutes (we see
    2.5 minutes, consistently) the VM should finally be able to get an
    address. After a flurry of additional messages you should see<br>
    <br>
    <div style="color: #000000;background-color: #fffffe;font-family: Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace;font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;line-height: 18px;white-space: pre;"><div><span style="color: #008080;">Please</span><span style="color: #000000;"> press enter to activate </span><span style="color: #0000ff;">this</span><span style="color: #000000;"> console</span></div></div>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <br>
    Press enter and you'll get a prompt.<br>
    <br>
    If the VM does nothing for longer than a few minutes, power off and
    on the VM and try again. If you still cannot get an address at all
    then something else has gone wrong. We have observed during testing
    that not removing the "Empty" CD/DVD when setting up the storage can
    result in this problem; see step 2, above. Another problem is not
    having the DHCP server enabled for the host-only network; see step
    3.<br>
    <h3>6. Get the IP address for the BadStore VM.</h3>
    From the command prompt in the BadStore VM, execute the command<br>
    <br>
    <div style="color: #000000;background-color: #fffffe;font-family: Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace;font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;line-height: 18px;white-space: pre;"><div><span style="color: #000000;">ifconfig eth0 </span></div></div>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <br>
    It will output network information. Write down the IP address
    following "inet addr" in the output. It will be something like
    192.168.56.110, which is the lower bound configured for the DHCP
    server in step 3. If you get an error like<br>
    <br>
    <div style="color: #000000;background-color: #fffffe;font-family: Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace;font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;line-height: 18px;white-space: pre;"><div><span style="color: #000000;">ifconfig: eth0: error fetching interface information: </span><span style="color: #008080;">Device</span><span style="color: #000000;"> not found</span></div></div>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <br>
    Then this means that your network configuration was messed up; see
    troubleshooting suggestions in step 5.<br>
    <h3>7. Add the BadStore IP address to your non-virtual computer's
      hosts file.</h3>
    To visit the site <a moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="http://www.badstore.net/">www.badstore.net</a> being run by
    your virtual machine, you will have to edit the hosts file on your
    host (non-virtual, non-guest) computer so that when your host
    computer's web browser looks up www.badstore.net, it resolves to
    your virtual machine's address instead of a system on the Internet.
    If the IP address you wrote down in step 6 was 192.168.56.110, you
    should add the following on a new line in the hosts file:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="color: #000000;background-color: #fffffe;font-family: Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace;font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;line-height: 18px;white-space: pre;"><div><span style="color: #098658;">192.168</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span><span style="color: #098658;">56.110</span><span style="color: #000000;"> www.badstore.net</span></div></div>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <br>
    Here are some instructions for finding and editing your hosts file
    on <a moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://support.cloudways.com/entries/21945802-How-to-edit-your-hosts-file-Windows-7-">Windows</a>
    and <a moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="http://www.tekrevue.com/tip/edit-hosts-file-mac-os-x/">Mac
      OS</a>. For Linux, edit /etc/hosts as root and add the above line
    (e.g., using the nano editor you could type <b>sudo nano -w
      /etc/hosts</b> to edit the file).<br>
    <h3>8. Point your browser at www.badstore.net.</h3>
    It should show the splash page for the BadStore, which displays a
    black-and-white picture of an old-west-style saloon. If instead your
    browser hangs, or goes to a different-looking page, then the hosts
    file is not being accessed correctly.<br>
    <br>
    Note that if you reboot the BadStore VM, its address may change, so
    you will have to edit the hosts file again. You should, however, be
    able to close the running VM, saving its state rather than powering
    it off. When you restart it, it should restart the network and
    reconnect using the same address (which you can confirm using the
    ifconfig command from step 6, above).<br>
    <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
    If you find that you cannot access BadStore VM, and you are using
    VMWare, or you get an error from the VM such as "ifconfig: eth0:
    error fetching interface information: Device not found", try
    modifying the VM configuration to change the controller for the
    CD-ROM and hard drive to IDE from SATA.<br>
    <h2>Tools</h2>
    You will want to use various tools to interact with BadStore, to
    inspect and modify the contents of its pages and communications. We
    recommend some tools here.<br>
    <h3>Firefox developer tools</h3>
    Firefox <a moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools">developer
      tools</a> give you the ability to inspect and modify the contents
    of a web page and its communications (from the Developer Tools page,
    click the DEBUGGING menu item to show the tools you should be most
    interested in). Developer Tools come pre-installed with recent
    versions of Firefox; just go to the Web Developer menu to see the
    possible tools. We will list some useful features here, along with
    links to the relevant documentation.<br>
    <br>
    <b>View Source</b>. This is a normal Firefox feature. Right-click on
    a page you are viewing and then select "View Source" from the menu
    that appears. A window pops up that gives a complete,
    syntax-highlighted view of the page source. This view is useful for
    doing quick searches. For example, use the view to search for hidden
    form fields (those fields with the attribute "hidden")<br>
    <br>
    <b>Page Inspector</b>. You can use the <a moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector">page

      inspector</a> this to examine and modify the structure of a page.
    Use the source inspector to find pages of interest, and then use the
    Page inspector to see how the different source elements map to what
    is displayed, and/or to modify the contents of those pages.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Developer Toolbar</b>. The <a moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/GCLI">Developer

      Toolbar</a> is a console prompt will allow you to inspect and/or
    set cookies associated with the current page, among other things.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Network traffic inspector</b>. While viewing a page in the page
    inspector, you can click the Network tab to see the network traffic
    sent or received as a result of interacting with the page. Use this
    to see cookies sent/received, HTTP headers, request formats, etc.<br>
    <h3>Other utilities</h3>
    Here are other utilities you might find useful:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Use this on-line utility to <a moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="http://ostermiller.org/calc/encode.html">decode or
          encode base64 and other formats</a></li>
      <li>Use this on-line utility to <a moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="http://www.sha1-online.com/">generate cryptographic
          hashes</a> including MD5, SHA1, and more.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Exploit!</h2>
    Perform exploits on BadStore to find answers to the following
    questions; once you have, complete the <a moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="assets/week3_badstore_quiz.docx">on-line assessment</a>.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>One of the BadStore pages has a hidden form field that
        establishes a new user's privilege level. What is the name of
        this field?</li>
      <li>How many items for purchase are in BadStore's database? Use
        SQL injection on the quick search form field to find out.</li>
      <li>What operations are suppliers permitted to do once they have
        logged into the "suppliers only" area? Use SQL injection to
        bypass authentication, or find a way to create an account as a
        supplier.</li>
      <li>Log in as <b>joe@supplier.com</b> --- this is possible in a
        variety of ways, including SQL injection. Then look at his
        previous orders and answer the question: What credit card number
        did he use to make a purchase of $46.95? Multiple answers are
        possible, but we will accept all of them.</li>
      <li>Get administrator privileges and then use the <b>admin</b>
        action to look at the user database. There are two users whose
        emails have the form <b>XXX@whole.biz</b>; what is the <b>XXX</b>
        portion of either of the two users? For example, if one of the
        users is <b>jackie@whole.biz</b>, the right answer is <b>jackie</b>.
        (The answer is case-sensitive.)</li>
      <li>BadStore uses cookies to implement a session key, once you've
        authenticated, and for tracking the contents of the cart, once
        you've added something to it. You can figure out the cookies in
        use by BadStore in various ways. One way is to do an XSS attack
        on the guest book. Get the guest book to run the code <b>&lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookie)&lt;/script&gt;</b>
        and it will tell you the current cookies. (Be sure you have
        popups enabled on your browser or this won't work.)
        Alternatively, you can examine the cookies directly using
        Firefox developer tools. Recall that cookies are pairs <i>key=value</i>.
        What is the key of the session cookie?</li>
      <li>What is the key of the cookie used for the cart?</li>
      <li>BadStore's session cookie format is poorly designed because it
        is uses a predictable structure. In particular, it is an encoded
        string (with a URL-encoded newline at the end) of the form
        XXX:YYY:ZZZ:U. What are the XXX, YYY, and ZZZ portions of this
        string?</li>
      <li>BadStore's cart cookie is also an encoded string with a
        predictable structure XXX:YYY:... etc., and it probably contains
        information it shouldn't. Which field of the decoded string
        could an attacker change to give himself a discount on an item's
        price?</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Tips and Hints</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The <a moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="assets/BadStore_net_v2_1_Manual.pdf">BadStore manual</a>
        has a bunch of hints and tips about exploiting vulnerabilities.</li>
      <li>Recall that MySQL comments are two dashes <i>followed by a
          space</i> (not just two dashes alone).</li>
      <li>BadStore generates dynamic HTML using CGI. For example, the
        URL <b>https://www.badstore.net/cgi-bin/badstore.cgi?action=whatsnew</b>
        presents a page of "What's new" at BadStore, while the URL <b>https://www.badstore.net/cgi-bin/badstore.cgi?action=viewprevious</b>
        generates a page showing previous accounts. The only difference
        between these is what's in the action parameter. Try handcrafted
        parameters to the various CGI URLs, e.g., <b>?action=test</b>
        and <b>?action=admin</b>.</li>
      <li>Ordering from the store <i>should</i> work by just clicking
        on "Add to Cart" from the "What's new?" page. But this doesn't
        work if you reach the page via https rather than http; it seems
        that Firefox blocks the javascript that updates the cart. When
        you go to the "Supplier Login" area, it will switch you to https
        and then it will stay that way. You can flip back to http by
        just changing the URL manually.</li>
      <li>Some of the questions require that you get administrator
        privileges. You can get admin privileges in several ways,
        including SQL injection (if you can guess the administrator's
        user ID), spoofing the cookie (per the structure that you
        glean), or creating a user with administrative rights (using the
        page with the hidden form field). While normal users have role U
        administrators have role A.</li>
      <li>Visit <b>http://www.badstore.net/cgi-bin/initdbs.cgi</b> to
        reset the directories and databases. This is easier than
        rebooting BadStore, if you want a fresh start. It does not reset
        your cookies, though.</li>
