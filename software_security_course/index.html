    <h1>Software Security On-line Course<br>
    </h1>
    <br>
    This course, originally developed in late 2014 and early 2015 for <a
      moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://coursera.org/">Coursera</a>
    as part of the <a moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="https://www.umd.edu/">University of Maryland</a>'s<b> </b>four-course



    specialization on cybersecurity, explores the <b>foundations of
      software security</b>. The course is old enough now that I don't
    feel comfortable charging money for it, so it is here hosted for
    free. See <a moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="index.html#Note_about_Course_Content_written_in">more on the
      current state of the course content, and <b>invitation for
        contributions</b>, below</a>. All of the videos are collected on
    a <a moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLnvPv3HJdKJ8CYnNcFLUgw">Youtube
      channel, Software Security</a>.<br>
    <br>
    The course considers important software vulnerabilities and attacks
    that exploit them, such as <i> buffer overflows</i>, <i>SQL
      injection</i>, and <i>session hijacking</i>. The course also
    considers defenses that prevent or mitigate these attacks, including
    <i>advanced testing</i> and <i>program analysis</i> techniques. We
    take a <b>build security in</b> mentality, considering techniques
    at each phase of the development cycle that can be used to
    strengthen the security of software systems.<br>
    <br>
    A video overview of the course is presented in the following
    lectures. The first two present an overview of cybersecurity
    generally, and software security in particular. The last is an
    overview of the course content, and a description of the learner's
    expected background.<br>

    <h2>Topics</h2>
    The content of the course is as follows, with one topic per week
    linked to the relevant material:<br>
    <ol>
      <li><a moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="week1_memory_based_attacks.html"><b>Low-level,
            memory-based attacks</b></a>, including stack smashing,
        format string attacks, stale memory access attacks, and
        return-oriented Programming (ROP)</li>

    </ol>
    <p>We have put together a <a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="glossary.html">glossary of terms</a> that you might find
      useful while going through the course.<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
    </ol>
    <h2>Projects and Assessment<br>
    </h2>
    There is a quiz for each week's materials. Each quiz is stored in a
    Microsoft Word .docx file, which includes both the questions and the
    answer. (I didn't find time to split them apart.)<br>
    <br>
    The course also has three projects.<br>
    <ol>
      <li><a moz-do-not-send="true" href="project1_buffer_overflow.html"><b>Buffer




            overflow attacks</b></a>: The lab walks you through how a
        buffer overflow occurs, and how it can be exploited.</li>
      <li><a moz-do-not-send="true" href="project2_badstore.html"><b>Web
            application security</b></a>: The lab asks you to find and
        exploit common vulnerabilities in web applications, like SQL
        injection and cross-site scripting</li>
      <li><a moz-do-not-send="true" href="project3_fuzz_testing.html"><b>Static


            analysis for finding security bugs</b></a>: The lab will
        give you some experience using tools that aim to find security
        flaws automatically</li>
    </ol>
    To do the projects, you will need to install the <a
      moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Virtual
      Box</a> virtual machine management software (which is free) on
    your own computer. Projects will be in VM images running <a
      moz-do-not-send="true" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu Linux</a>;
    you will install these images and run them to do the projects.
    Detailed instructions for doing so are on the relevant project
    pages.<br>
    <h2>Expected Background<br>
    </h2>
    Successful learners in this course typically have completed
    sophomore/junior-level undergraduate work in a technical field, have
    some <b>familiarity with programming</b>, ideally in C/C++ and one
    other "managed" program language (like Python or Java), and have
    prior exposure to algorithms. Students not familiar with these
    languages but with others can improve their skills through online
    web tutorials. <br>
    <br>
    To test whether you have sufficient background to take the course,
    we recommend students take the <b><a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="assets/qualifying_quiz.docx">qualifying quiz</a></b>.
    Students who score less than 70% on the quiz may have difficulty
    with the technical concepts assumed by the presentations. (Note that
    the quiz does not count toward your final grade.) Much of the quiz
    is about <b>C programming</b>; most of the code in the course will
    be presented in C. <i>For the first two weeks, this is critical</i>:
    the low-level errors and defenses against them are germane to C and
    low-level programming. Students comfortable in other languages may
    be able to learn the necessary C concepts on their own. One book I
    recommend is K.A. Reek's <a moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="http://www.cs.rit.edu/~kar/pointers.on.c/">Pointers on C</a>.
    Several previous students of this course recommended the free book,
    <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://learncodethehardway.org/c/">Learning





      C the Hard Way</a>.<br>

    <h2><a name="Note_about_Course_Content_written_in"></a>Note about
      course content, and call for corrections<br>
    </h2>
    This course was originally put together in late 2014 and early 2015.
    Fortunately (for learning, not for security!), much of the course's
    core content is still relevant as of early 2024: The examples and
    some details are now nearly 10 years old, but the same sorts of
    vulnerabilities, attacks, defenses, methodologies, and technologies
    are still relevant. <br>
    <br>
    Some readings such as this one have some added discussion and links
    to newer versions, or generations, of tools and technologies, and/or
    writeups about them. The first such updates were made in 2020, and
    some of these links may be dead or out of date. <b>I welcome
      corrections and contributions!</b> If you come across a dead/wrong
    link or would like to suggest some commentary to add, please either
    <b>e-mail me</b> (mwh@cs.umd.edu) or better yet, make the suggested
    change and <b>submit a pull request on GitHub</b>, where these
    course materials are hosted.<br>
    <h3>Errata</h3>
    <p>There are some small mistakes in the video lectures for the
      course, identified below.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>Week 1</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><i><b>Other memory exploits</b></i> lecture: Slide 5 (titled
        Heap overflow variants) in the recorded lecture implies that all
        C++ objects have vtables, but in fact only those with virtual
        methods do. This point has been corrected in the (downloadable)
        PDF version of the slides.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Week 2</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><b><i>Week 2 Intro slide implies ROP bypasses stack cookies
            and ASLR</i></b>. The discussion was meant as a transition
        to thinking about more sophisticated attacks, but then seemed to
        imply that ROP is more powerful than it is. ROP is a way to
        overcome defenses against jumping to particular libc functions,
        by reusing together code fragments rather than whole functions.
        It does not bypass stack cookies or ASLR.</li>
      <li><b>There is a typo in the secure coding lecture, "Design vs
          Implementation."</b> Should be "consistent" instead of
        "consonant". This is fixed in the PDF slides.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Week 5</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Taintedness as a lattice</b>. In the flow analysis lecture,
        at time 5:00, Mike mis-speaks and says that tainted is less than
        untainted, which is wrong; it's the other way around. Note that
        he corrects himself immediately afterwards, and the slides are
        correct.</li>
    </ul>
