Numerical invariants, e.g., relationships among numerical variables
in a program, represent a useful class of properties to analyze programs.
General polynomial invariants represent more complex
numerical relations, but they are often required in many scientific
and engineering applications. We present NumInv, a tool that implements
a counterexample-guided invariant generation (CEGIR)
to automatically discover numerical invariants, which are polynomial
equality and inequality relations among numerical variables.
This CEGIR technique infers candidate invariants from program
traces and then checks them against the program source code using
the KLEE test-input generation tool. If the invariants are incorrect
KLEE returns counterexample traces, which help the dynamic
inference obtain better results. Existing CEGIR approaches often
require sound invariants, however NumInv sacrifices soundness
and produces results that KLEE cannot refute within certain time
bound. This design and the use of KLEE as a verifier allow NumInv
to discover useful and important numerical invariants for many
challenging programs.<p>
Preliminary results show that NumInv generates required invariants
for understanding and verifying correctness of programs
involving complex arithmetic. We also show that NumInv discovers
polynomial invariants that capture precise complexity bounds of
programs used to benchmark existing static complexity analysis
techniques. Finally, we show that NumInv performs competitively
comparing to state of the art numerical invariant analysis tools
