  In programming languages, existential quantification is useful for
  describing relationships among members of a structured type.  For
  example, we may have a list in which there <em>exists</em> some
  mutual exclusion lock <em>l</em> in each list element such that <em>l</em>
  protects the data stored in that element.
  With this information, a static analysis can reason
  about the relationship between locks and locations in the list even
  when the precise identity of the lock and/or location is unknown.
  To facilitate the construction of such static analyses, this paper
  presents a context-sensitive <em>label flow analysis</em> algorithm with
  support
  for existential quantification.  Label flow analysis is a core part
  of many static analysis systems.  Following Rehof et al, we use context-free
  language (CFL) reachability to develop an efficient <em>O</em>(<em>n</em><sup>3</sup>)
  label flow inference algorithm.  We prove the algorithm sound by reducing its
  derivations to those in a system based on
  polymorphically-constrained types, in the style of Mossin.  We have
  implemented a variant of our analysis as part of a data race detection
  tool for C programs.
