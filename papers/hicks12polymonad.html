  From their semantic origins to their use in structuring effectful
  computations, monads are now also used as a programming pattern to
  structure code in a number of important scenarios, including
  functional reactivity, information flow tracking and probabilistic
  computation. However, whilst these examples are inspired by monads
  they are not strictly speaking monadic but rather something more
  general. The first contribution of this paper is the definition of a
  new structure, the polymonad, which subsumes monads and encompasses
  the monad-like programming patterns that we have observed.  A
  concern is that given such a general setting, a program would
  quickly become polluted with polymonadic coercions, making it hard
  to read and maintain.  The second contribution of this paper is to
  build on previous work to define a polymorphic type inference
  algorithm that supports programming with polymonads using a direct
  style, e.g., as if computations of type <EM>M</EM> <EM>tau</EM> were expressions
  of type <EM>tau</EM>.  During type inference the program is rewritten to
  insert the necessary polymonadic coercions, a process that we prove
  is coherent-all sound rewritings produce programs with the same
  semantics.  The resulting programming style is powerful and
  lightweight.
