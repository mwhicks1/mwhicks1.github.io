We present here a methodology for programming active networks in the
environment defined by our new language PLAN (Packet Language for
Active Networks). This environment presumes a two-level architecture
consisting of:
<p><ol>
<em>active packets</em> carrying PLAN code; and
downloadable, node-resident <em>services</em> written in more
general-purpose languages.
</ol>
We present several examples which illustrate how these two features
can be combined to implement various network functions.<p>[&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~switchware/papers/progplan.ps">.ps</a>&nbsp;]
