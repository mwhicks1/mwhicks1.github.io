  The research and industrial communities have made
  great strides in developing sophisticated defect detection tools
  based on static analysis.  To date most of the work in this
  area has focused on developing novel static analysis
  <em>algorithms</em>, but has neglected study of other aspects of static
  analysis <em>tools</em>, particularly user interfaces.  In this work,
  we present a novel user interface toolkit called Path Projection
  that helps users visualize, navigate, and understand program paths,
  a common component of many tools' error reports.
  We performed a controlled user study to measure the benefit of Path
  Projection in triaging error reports from Locksmith, a data race
  detection tool for C .  We found that Path Projection improved
  participants' time to complete this task without affecting
  accuracy, while participants felt Path Projection was useful and
  strongly preferred it to a more standard viewer.
