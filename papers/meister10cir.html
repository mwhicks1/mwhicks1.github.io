  C static analysis tools often use intermediate representations (IRs)
  that organize program data in a simple, well-structured
  manner. However, the C parsers that create IRs are slow, and because
  they are difficult to write, only a few implementations exist,
  limiting the languages in which a C static analysis can be written. To
  solve these problems, we investigate two language-independent,
  on-disk representations of C IRs: one using XML, and the other using
  an Internet standard binary encoding called XDR. We benchmark the
  parsing speeds of both options, finding the XML to be about a factor
  of two slower than parsing C and the XDR
  over six times faster.
  Furthermore, we show that the XML files are far too large
  at 19 times the size of C source code, while XDR is only 2.2 times
  the C size. We also demonstrate the
  portability of our XDR system by presenting a C source code querying tool in
  Ruby. Our solution and the insights we gained from building it will
  be useful to analysis authors and other clients of C IRs. We have made
  our software freely available for download at
