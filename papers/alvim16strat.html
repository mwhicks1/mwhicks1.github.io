    Traditional approaches to Quantitative Information Flow (QIF)
  represent the adversary's prior knowledge about how secrets
  are generated as a single probability distribution.
  Although adequate when a unique random procedure is used to 
  generate secrets, this representation may overlook important 
  structure often present in the secret-generation process.
  For instance, the representation of prior knowledge about
  passwords of a system's users as a single distribution 
  overlooks the fact  that many users generate passwords using 
  some <em>strategy</em>, and that knowledge of such strategies can 
  help the adversary in guessing the secret.
  The result is a potential underestimation of the vulnerability of the 
  secret.
  In this paper we explicitly model strategies as 
  distributions on secrets, and  generalize the representation of 
  the adversary's prior knowledge from a distribution on secrets
  to an <em>environment</em>, which is a distribution on strategies 
  (and, thus, a distribution on distributions on secrets, 
  called a <em>hyper-distribution</em>).
  By applying information-theoretic techniques to environments 
  we derive several meaningful generalizations of the traditional
  approach to QIF.
  In particular, we are able to disentangle the 
  <em>vulnerability of a secret</em> from the <em>vulnerability of the strategies</em> 
  that generate secrets, and thereby we can distinguish <em>security
  from aggregation</em>-which relies on the uncertainty over
  strategies-and <em>real security</em>-which relies on the
  intrinsic uncertainty within a strategy.
  We also demonstrate that, in a precise way, no further generalization
  of prior knowledge 
  (e.g., by using distributions of even higher order) 
  is needed to soundly quantify the vulnerability of the secret.
