  Cyclone is a polymorphic, type-safe programming language derived
  from C .  The primary design goals of Cyclone are to let
  programmers control data representations and memory management
  without sacrificing type-safety.  In this paper, we focus on the
  region-based memory management of Cyclone and its static typing
  discipline.  The design incorporates several advancements, including
  support for region subtyping and a coherent integration with stack
  allocation and a garbage collector.  To support separate
  compilation, Cyclone requires programmers to write some explicit
  region annotations, but uses a combination of default annotations,
  local type inference, and a novel treatment of region effects to
  reduce this burden.  As a result, we integrate C idioms in a
  region-based framework.  In our experience, porting legacy C to
  Cyclone has required altering about 8% of the code; of the
  changes, only 6% (of the 8%) were region annotations.
