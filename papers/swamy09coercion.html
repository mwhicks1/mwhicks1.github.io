  A number of important program rewriting scenarios can be recast as
  type-directed coercion insertion. These range from more theoretical
  applications such as coercive subtyping and supporting overloading
  in type theories, to more practical applications such as integrating
  static and dynamically typed code using gradual typing, and inlining
  code to enforce security policies such as access control and
  provenance tracking.  In this paper we give a general theory of
  type-directed coercion insertion.
  We specifically explore the inherent tradeoff between
  expressiveness and ambiguity---the more powerful the strategy for
  generating coercions, the greater the possibility of several,
  semantically distinct rewritings for a given program.  We consider
  increasingly powerful coercion generation strategies, work out
  example applications supported by the increased power (including
  those mentioned above), and identify the inherent ambiguity problems
  of each setting, along with various techniques to tame the
  ambiguities.
