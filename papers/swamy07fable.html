<font size="+1"><b>Fable: A Language for Enforcing User-defined Security Policies</b>.
  Nikhil Swamy and Michael Hicks, July 2007.</font><p>
An increasing number of applications have need to enforce some kind of
security policy.  A variety of language-based techniques have been proposed
toward assuring that particular sorts of security policy are properly
enforced.  However, these approaches typically fix the style of security
policy and overall security goal, e.g., information flow policies with a
goal of noninterference.  This limits the programmer's ability to combine
policy styles and to apply customized enforcement techniques while still
being assured the system is secure.<P>
As a step to addressing this problem, this paper presents Fable, a core
formalism for a programming language in which programmers may specify 
security policies and reason that these policies are properly
enforced.  In Fable, security policies are expressed by associating
<em>security labels</em> with the data or actions they protect via dependent
types.  Programmers define the semantics of labels in a separate part of the
program called the <em>enforcement policy</em>.  Labeled terms may only be
constructed and destructed within the enforcement policy, ensuring that it
cannot be circumvented.  Fable uses substructural types to track effects
in labels so that a policy whose enforcement must consider effects (e.g.,
due to references) or is itself effectful (e.g., a reference monitor) is
still assured of complete mediation.  Fable is flexible enough to
implement a wide variety of security policies.  As examples, we show how
Fable can be used to express policies for access control, information flow
(which we prove enforces noninterference), trusted declassification,
and security automata.
