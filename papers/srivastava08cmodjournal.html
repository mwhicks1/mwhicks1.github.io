  This paper presents CMod, a novel tool that provides a sound
  module system for C .  CMod works by enforcing a set of four
  rules that are based on principles of modular reasoning and on
  current programming practice.  CMod's rules flesh out the
  convention that <tt>.h</tt> header files are module interfaces and
  <tt>.c</tt> source files are module implementations.  Although this
  convention is well-known, existing explanations of it are
  incomplete, omitting important subtleties needed for soundness.  In
  contrast, we have proven formally that CMod's rules enforce both
  information hiding and type-safe linking.<p>
  To use CMod, the programmer develops and builds their software as
  usual, redirecting the compiler and linker to CMod's wrappers.  We
  evaluated CMod by applying it to 30 open source
  programs, totaling more than one million lines of code.  Violations to
  CMod's rules revealed more than a thousand information hiding errors,
  dozens of typing errors, and hundreds of cases that, although  not
  currently bugs, make programming mistakes more likely as the code
  evolves.  At the same time, programs generally adhere
  to the assumptions underlying CMod's rules, and so we could fix rule violations
  with a modest effort.  We conclude that CMod can effectively support
  modular programming in C: it soundly enforces type-safe linking and
  information hiding while being largely compatible with existing practice.
