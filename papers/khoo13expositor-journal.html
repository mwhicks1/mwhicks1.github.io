  We present Expositor, a new debugging environment that combines
  scripting and time-travel debugging to allow programmers to automate
  complex debugging tasks. The fundamental abstraction provided by
  Expositor is the <em>execution trace</em>, which is a time-indexed
  sequence of program state snapshots or projections thereof.
  Programmers can manipulate traces as if they were simple
  lists with operations such as map and filter. Under the hood,
  Expositor efficiently implements traces as lazy, sparse
  interval trees whose contents are materialized on demand.
  Expositor also provides a novel data
  structure, the <em>edit hash array mapped trie</em>, which is a lazy
  implementation of sets, maps, multisets, and multimaps that enables
  programmers to maximize the efficiency of their debugging scripts.
  In our micro-benchmarks, Expositor scripts are faster than
  the equivalent non-lazy scripts for common debugging scenarios.  We have also used
  Expositor to debug a stack overflow, and to unravel a subtle
  data race in Firefox. We believe that
  Expositor represents an important step forward in improving the
  technology for diagnosing complex, hard-to-understand bugs.
