  Brian&nbsp;J. Corcoran, Nikhil Swamy, and Michael Hicks, March 2008.</font><p>
This paper presents SELinks, an extension of the Links web
programming language, that allows a database and web server to
collaboratively enforce a security policy with high assurance. Our
approach has a number of benefits. First, the relationship between
data and its security label is made explicit by the SELinks type
system, which allows the compiler to ensure that a policy is always
correctly enforced.  Next, application-specific logic is communicated
seamlessly to the database by compiling SELinks code and values to
user-defined functions and custom datatypes, respectively, to be
stored in the database.  As a result, application-specific security
policies can be enforced at the database while processing queries,
improving both the overall efficiency of the application, as well as
ensuring that sensitive data never leaves the database needlessly. Our
experience with two sizeable web applications indicates that
cross-tier policy enforcement in SELinks is flexible, relatively easy
to use and improves efficiency, in terms of increased throughput, by
as much as an order of magnitude.
