 Technical Report MS-CIS-98-05, Department of Computer and Information
  Science, University of Pennsylvania, April 1998.</font><p>The design objectives and the mechanisms for achieving those
objectives are considered for each of three systems, Java, Erlang, and
TIL. In particular, I examine the use of types and intermediate
representations in the system implementation. In addition, the systems
are compared to examine how one system's mechanisms may (or may not)
be applied to another.<p>[&nbsp;<a href="https://mwhicks1.github.io/papers/typedIR.ps">.ps</a>&nbsp;]
