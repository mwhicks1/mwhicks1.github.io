The primary goal of active networking is to increase the pace of
network evolution.  The approach to achieving this goal, as well
as the goal of enhancing customizability, is to allow network
nodes to be extended by dynamically loaded code. Most active
network implementations employ <em>plug-in extensibility</em>, a
technique for loading code characterized by a concrete,
pre-defined abstraction of future change.  After giving examples
of plug-in extensibility, we argue that while it is flexible and
convenient, it is not sufficient to facilitate true evolution of
the network. To remedy this problem, we propose the use of <em>
dynamic software updating</em>.  Dynamic software updating reduces the
<em>a priori</em> assumptions of plug-in extensibility, improving
flexibility and eliminating the need to pre-plan extensions.
However, this additional flexibility results in additional
complexity and creates issues involving validity and security. We
discuss these issues, and describe the state-of-the-art in systems
that support dynamic software updating, thus framing the problem
for  researchers developing next-generation active networks.
