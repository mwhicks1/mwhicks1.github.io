  Recently, there has been much interest in dynamic software updating
  (DSU) systems, which allow running programs to be patched on-the-fly
  to add features or fix bugs.  Open-source and commercial products
  are now available to support dynamic updates to OS kernels, desktop
  applications, server programs, and embedded devices.  However,
  despite the many recent advances in DSU mechanisms, techniques to
  reason that dynamic updates are correct have lagged behind, focusing
  largely on simple properties like type safety.<P>
  In this paper, we present a more complete framework for specifying
  and verifying the correctness of dynamic updates.  Our framework is
  capable of describing application-specific, behavioral notions of
  correctness.  We use our framework to characterize several
  classes of program properties that arise in updatable
  software.<P>
  To verify such properties in actual updatable programs, we develop a
  transformation that combines the old and new versions of a program
  into a single <em>merged program</em>.  This merged program is
  provably equivalent to running the old and new programs in a DSU
  system, and, most importantly, the merged program can be analyzed by
  off-the-shelf program analysis tools.  We describe an implementation
  of a program merger we have developed for C, and we demonstrate its
  utility with several case studies.
