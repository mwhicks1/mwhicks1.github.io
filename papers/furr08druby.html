  Many general-purpose, object-oriented scripting languages are
  dynamically typed, which provides flexibility but leaves the
  programmer without the benefits of static typing, including early
  error detection and the documentation provided by type
  annotations.  This paper describes Diamondback Ruby
  (DRuby), a tool that blends Ruby's dynamic type system with a
  static typing discipline.  DRuby provides a type
  language that is rich enough to precisely type Ruby code we have
  encountered, without unneeded complexity.
  When possible, DRuby infers static types to discover
  type errors in Ruby programs.  When necessary, the programmer can
  provide DRuby with
  annotations that assign static types to dynamic code.  These
  annotations are checked at run time, isolating type errors to
  unverified code.  We applied DRuby to a suite of benchmarks and
  found several bugs that would cause run-time type
  errors. DRuby also reported a number of warnings that reveal questionable
  programming practices in the benchmarks. We believe that DRuby
  takes a major step toward bringing the benefits
  of combined static and dynamic typing to Ruby and other
  object-oriented languages.
