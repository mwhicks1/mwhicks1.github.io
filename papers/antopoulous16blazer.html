  We describe a novel technique for proving <EM>k</EM>-safety properties (non-interference, determinism, etc.) via a decomposition that enables one to leverage non-relational reasoning techniques. The key is the inter-operation of the following principles. First, we observe that many <EM>k</EM>-safety properties of interest have a particular structure that we call <EM>psi</EM>-quotient partitionability where <EM>psi</EM> is a <EM>k</EM>-ary formula. Second, we develop a partitioning strategy of execution traces based on the <EM>k</EM>-safety property <EM>Phi</EM> of interest such that if <EM>psi</EM> holds for <EM>k</EM> traces then they must be in the same partition. Finally, within a partition component <EM>T</EM><sub>i</sub>, we observe that we can prove <EM>k</EM>-safety by instead proving a universal property: all traces within the partition satisfy some common property <EM>P</EM><sub>i</sub>, chosen to be strong enough that it implies the <EM>k</EM>-safety property <EM>Phi</EM> of any <EM>k</EM>-tuple of traces in components <EM>T</EM><sub>i</sub>.<P>
We apply this strategy to the task of discovering timing side channels. A key feature of our approach is a demand-driven partitioning strategy that uses high/low-annotated regex-like trails to reason about one partition component of execution traces at a time. We have applied our technique in a prototype implementation tool called Blazer, based on WALA, PPL, Z3, and the brics automaton library. We have proved non-interference of (or synthesized an attack specification for) 25 programs written in Java bytecode, including 7 classic examples from the literature, and 6 examples extracted from the DARPA STAC challenge problems.
