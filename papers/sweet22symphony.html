  Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) refers to a family of
cryptographic techniques with which
mutually untrusting parties may compute arbitrary functions of
their private inputs while revealing only the function output. MPC has
broad application, but it can be hard to program MPCs correctly and efficiently,
especially when they require coordinating disparate computational roles.
We present Symphony, a new functional programming language for
MPC whose programs can easily coordinate many parties, and whose
<em>first-class shares</em> and <em>first-class party sets</em> provide
unmatched language-level expressive power. Symphony generalizes the
single-instruction, multiple-data (SIMD) semantics of prior MPC
languages, and
using a core language called , we prove that this
intuitive, generalized SIMD view of a program coincides with its
actual distributed semantics.
Thus the programmer can reason about her programs by reading them from top to bottom, even though in reality the program runs distributed across many machines.
We implemented a prototype interpreter for Symphony and
with it wrote a variety of MPC programs, finding that it can express
optimized protocols that other languages cannot. We also measured 
the performance of the interpreter on several benchmark programs.
Despite Symphony's added expressiveness, we find its performance is
competitive with Obliv-C, a state-of-the-art two-party MPC
framework for C .
