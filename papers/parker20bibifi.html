Typical security contests focus on breaking or mitigating the impact
  of buggy systems. We present the Build-it, Break-it, Fix-it
  (BIBIFI) contest, which aims to assess the ability to securely
  build software, not just break it. In BIBIFI, teams build specified
  software with the goal of maximizing correctness, performance, and
  security. The latter is tested when teams attempt to break other
  teams' submissions. Winners are chosen from among the best builders
  and the best breakers. BIBIFI was designed to be open-ended---teams
  can use any language, tool, process, etc. that they like. As such,
  contest outcomes shed light on factors that correlate with
  successfully building secure software and breaking insecure
  software. We ran three contests involving a total of 156
  teams and three different programming problems. 
  Quantitative analysis
  from these contests found that the most efficient build-it
  submissions used C/C++, but submissions coded in a statically-type safe
  language were 11&#215; less likely to have a security flaw than C/C++ submissions.
	Break-it teams that were also successful build-it teams were
  significantly better at finding security bugs.
