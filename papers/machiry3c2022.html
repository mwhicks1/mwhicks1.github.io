    Owing to the continued use of C (and C++), spatial safety violations
  (e.g., buffer overflows) still constitute one of today's most
  dangerous and prevalent security vulnerabilities. To combat these
  violations, <em>Checked C</em> extends C with bounds-enforced
  <em>checked pointer</em> types. Checked C is essentially a
  <em>gradually typed</em> spatially safe C---checked pointers are
  backwards-binary compatible with legacy pointers, and the language
  allows them to be added piecemeal, rather than necessarily all at
  once, so that safety retrofitting can be incremental.<p>
  This paper presents a semi-automated process for porting a legacy C
  program to Checked C . The process centers on 3C, a static
  analysis-based annotation tool. 3C employs two novel static
  analysis algorithms---typ3c and boun3c---to annotate legacy
  pointers as checked pointers, and to infer array bounds annotations
  for pointers that need them. 3C performs a <em>root cause
    analysis</em> to direct a human developer to code that should be
  refactored; once done, 3C can be re-run to infer further
  annotations (and updated root causes).
  Experiments on 11 programs totaling 319KLoC show 3C
  to be effective at inferring checked pointer types, and experience
  with previously and newly ported code finds 3C works well when
  combined with human-driven refactoring.
