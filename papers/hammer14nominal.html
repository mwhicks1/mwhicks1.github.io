  Over the past thirty years, there has been significant progress in
  developing general-purpose, language-based approaches to
  <em>incremental computation</em>, which aims to efficiently update the
  result of a computation when an input is changed. A key design
  challenge in such approaches is how to provide efficient incremental
  support for a broad range of programs.  In this paper, we argue that
  first-class <em>names</em> are a critical linguistic feature for
  efficient incremental computation. Names identify computations to be
  reused across differing runs of a program, and making them first
  class gives programmers a high level of control over reuse. We
  demonstrate the benefits of names by presenting Nominal Adapton, an
  ML-like language for incremental computation with names. We describe
  how to use Nominal Adapton to efficiently incrementalize several
  standard programming patterns---including maps, folds, and
  unfolds---and show how to build efficient, incremental probabilistic
  trees and tries. Since Nominal Adapton's implementation is subtle,
  we formalize it as a core calculus and prove it is
  <em>from-scratch consistent</em>, meaning it always produces the same
  answer as simply re-running the computation. Finally, we demonstrate
  that Nominal Adapton can provide large speedups over both
  from-scratch computation and Adapton, a previous state-of-the-art
  incremental system.
