This paper presents RX, a new security-typed
programming language with features intended to make the management of
information-flow policies more practical.  Security labels in RX,
in contrast to prior approaches, are defined in terms of <em>owned
roles</em>, as found in the RT role-based trust-management framework.
Role-based security policies allows flexible delegation, and our
language RX provides constructs through which programs can robustly
update policies and react to policy updates dynamically.  Our dynamic
semantics use statically verified <em>transactions</em> to eliminate
illegal information flows across updates, which we call
<em>transitive flow</em>.  Because policy updates can be observed
through dynamic queries, policy updates can potentially reveal
sensitive information.  As such, RX considers policy statements
themselves to be potentially confidential information and subject to
information-flow <em>metapolicies</em>.
