We present a novel approach to proving the absence of timing channels.
The idea is to partition the program's execution traces in such a way
that each partition component is checked for timing attack
resilience by a time complexity analysis and that per-component
resilience implies the resilience of the whole program.  We construct
a partition by splitting the program traces at
secret-independent branches.  This ensures that any pair of traces
with the same public input has a component containing both
traces.  Crucially, the per-component checks can be normal <em>safety
properties</em> expressed in terms of a single execution.  Our approach is
thus in contrast to prior approaches, such as <em>self-composition</em>,
that aim to reason about multiple (<em>k</em>&gt;=2) executions at once.<p>
We formalize the above as an approach called <em>quotient partitioning</em>,
generalized to any <em>k</em>-safety property, and prove it to be sound. A
key feature of our approach is a demand-driven partitioning strategy
that uses a regex-like notion called <em>trails</em> to identify sets of
execution traces, particularly those influenced by tainted (or secret)
data.
We have applied our technique in a prototype implementation
tool called <em>Blazer</em>, based on WALA, PPL, and the brics
automaton library.
We have proved timing-channel freedom of (or synthesized an attack
specification for) 24 programs
written in Java bytecode, including 6 classic examples from the literature and 6
examples extracted from the DARPA STAC challenge problems.
