In secure multi-party computation, mutually distrusting parties
cooperatively compute functions of their private data; in the process,
they only learn certain results as per the protocol (e.g., the final
output).
The realization of these protocols uses cryptographic techniques to
avoid leaking information between the parties.
A protocol for a secure computation can sometimes be optimized without
changing its security guarantee:
when the parties can use their private data and the revealed output to
infer the values of other data, then this other data need not be
concealed from them via cryptography.<p>
In the context of automatically optimizing secure multi-party
computation, we define two related problems, <em>knowledge
  inference</em> and <em>constructive knowledge inference</em>.
In both problems, we attempt to automatically discover when and if
intermediate variables used in a protocol will (eventually) be known
to the parties involved in the computation.
Provably-known variables offer optimization opportunities.<p>
We formally state the problem of knowledge inference (and its
constructive variant); we describe our solutions, which are built atop
existing, standard technology such as SMT solvers.
We show that our approach is sound, and further, we
characterize the completeness properties enjoyed by our approach.
We have implemented our approach, and present a preliminary experimental evaluation.
