  Recent years have seen significant advances in dynamic software
  updating (DSU) systems, which allow programs to be patched on the
  fly.  Most DSU systems employ automatic safety checks to avoid
  applying a patch if doing so may lead to incorrect behavior.
  This
  paper presents what we believe is the first comprehensive empirical evaluation
  of the two most significant DSU safety checks: <em>activeness
    safety</em> (AS), which disallows patches that modify functions
  on the stack, and <em>con-freeness safety</em>
  (CFS), which allows modifications to active functions, but only
  when doing so will be type safe.<p>
  To measure the checks' effectiveness, we tested them
  against three years of updates to OpenSSH and
  vsftpd.  We performed this testing using a novel DSU testing methodology that
  systematically applies updates throughout the
  execution of a test suite.  After testing updates to both
  applications in this way, we tracked how often the safety checks
  allow updates and which updates result in
  test failures.  We found that updating without safety checks
  produced
  many failures, and that both AS and CFS dramatically reduced, but did not
  fully eliminate, these failures.  CFS yielded more failures
  than AS, but
  AS was more restrictive than CFS, disallowing far
  more successful updates.
  Our results suggest that neither AS nor CFS is likely
  suitable for general-purpose DSU on its own.
  Indeed, we found that selecting update points manually could
  avoid all failures while still permitting sufficient updates.
  Our results present a challenge and important insights for future
  work: to discover 
  safe and sufficient update points fully automatically.
