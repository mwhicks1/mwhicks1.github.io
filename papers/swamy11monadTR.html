  Many useful programming constructions can be expressed as monads.
  Examples include probabilistic computations,
  time-varying expressions, parsers, and information flow tracking,
  not to mention effectful features like state and I/O.  In this
  paper, we present a type-based rewriting algorithm to make
  programming with arbitrary monads as easy as using ML's built-in
  support for state and I/O.  Developers write programs using monadic
  values of type <em>M</em>&nbsp;<em>t</em> as if they were of type <em>t</em>, and our algorithm
  inserts the necessary binds, units, and monad-to-monad morphisms so
  that the program typechecks.  Our algorithm is based on Jones'
  qualified types and enjoys three useful properties: (1) principal
  types, i.e., the rewriting we perform is the most general; (2)
  coherence, i.e., thanks to the monad and morphism laws, all
  instances of the principal rewriting have the same semantics; (3)
  decidability; i.e., the solver for generated constraints will always
  terminate.  Throughout the paper we present simple examples from the
  domains listed above.  Our most complete example, which illustrates
  the expressive power of our system, proves that ML programs
  rewritten by our algorithm to use the information flow monad are
  equivalent to programs in FlowCaml, a domain-specific information
  flow tracking language.
