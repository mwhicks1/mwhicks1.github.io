Dynamic software updating (DSU) systems allow running programs to be patched on-the-fly to add features or fix bugs. While dynamic updates can be tricky to write, techniques for establishing their correctness have received little attention. In this paper, we present the first methodology for automatically verifying the correctness of dynamic updates. Programmers express the desired properties of an updated execution using client-oriented specifications (CO-specs), which can describe a wide range of client-visible behaviors. We verify CO-specs automatically by using off-the-shelf tools to analyze a merged program, which is a combination of the old and new versions of a program. We formalize the merging transformation and prove it correct. We have implemented a program merger for C, and applied it to updates for the Redis key-value store and several synthetic programs. Using Thor, a verification tool, we could verify many of the synthetic programs; using Otter, a symbolic executor, we could analyze every program, often in less than a minute. Both tools were able to detect faulty patches and incurred only a factor-of-four slowdown, on average, compared to single version programs.},

  title = {Evaluating Dynamic Software Update Safety Using Efficient Systematic Testing},

  abstract = {
Dynamic software updating (DSU) systems patch programs on the fly without incurring downtime. To avoid failures due to the updating process itself, many DSU systems employ timing restrictions. However, timing restrictions are theoretically imperfect, and their practical effectiveness is an open question. This paper presents the first significant empirical evaluation of three popular timing restrictions: activeness safety (AS), which prevents updates to active functions; confreeness safety (CFS), which only allows modifications to active functions when doing so is provably type-safe; and manual identification of the event-handling loops during which an update may occur. We evaluated these timing restrictions using a series of DSU patches to three programs: OpenSSH, vsftpd, and ngIRCd.We systematically applied updates at each distinct update point reached during execution of a suite of system tests for these programs to determine which updates pass and which fail. We found that all three timing restrictions prevented most failures, but only manual identification allowed none. Further, although CFS and AS allowed many more update points, manual identification still supported updates with minimal delay. Finally, we found that manual identification required the least developer effort. Overall, we conclude that manual identification is most effective.

  Recent years have seen significant advances in dynamic software
  updating (DSU) systems, which allow programs to be patched on the
  fly.  Most DSU systems employ automatic safety checks to avoid
  applying a patch if doing so may lead to incorrect behavior.
  This
  paper presents what we believe is the first comprehensive empirical evaluation
  of the two most significant DSU safety checks: \emph{activeness
    safety} (AS), which disallows patches that modify functions
  on the stack, and \emph{con-freeness safety}
  (CFS), which allows modifications to active functions, but only
  when doing so will be type safe.

  To measure the checks' effectiveness, we tested them
  against three years of updates to Open\-SSH and
  vsftpd.  We performed this testing using a novel DSU testing methodology that
  systematically applies updates throughout the
  execution of a test suite.  After testing updates to both
  applications in this way, we tracked how often the safety checks
  allow updates and which updates result in
  test failures.  We found that updating without safety checks
  produced
  many failures, and that both AS and CFS dramatically reduced, but did not
  fully eliminate, these failures.  CFS yielded more failures
  than AS, but
  AS was more restrictive than CFS, disallowing far
  more successful updates.
  Our results suggest that neither AS nor CFS is likely
  suitable for general-purpose DSU on its own.
  Indeed, we found that selecting update points manually could
  avoid all failures while still permitting sufficient updates.
  Our results present a challenge and important insights for future
  work: to discover 
  safe and sufficient update points fully automatically.

  title = {Contextual Effects for Version-Consistent Dynamic Software Updating
  and Safe Concurrent Programming (extended version)},
  abstract = {
This paper presents a generalization of standard effect systems that
we call \emph{contextual effects}.  A traditional effect system
computes the effect of an expression $e$.  Our system additionally
computes the effects of the computational context in which $e$ occurs:
both the effect of the computation that has already occurred
(\emph{prior effects}) and the effect of the computation yet to take
place (\emph{future effects}).

Contextual effects can be used in any application in which the past or
future computation of the program is relevant at various program points.  We
present two substantial examples.  First, we show how prior and future
effects can be used to enforce \emph{transactional version consistency}
(TVC), a novel correctness property for dynamic software updates. TVC
ensures that programmer-designated transactional code blocks appear to
execute entirely at the same code version, even if a dynamic update occurs
in the middle of the block.  Second, we show how future effects can be used
in the analysis of multi-threaded programs to find thread-shared locations.
This is an essential step in applications such as data race detection.
