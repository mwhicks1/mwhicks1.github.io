  Dynamic software updating (DSU) systems, which allow programs to be
  patched on the fly, often employ automatic safety checks to avoid
  applying a patch that may lead to incorrect behavior.
  This paper presents what we believe is the first significant empirical 
  evaluation of two DSU safety checks: <em>activeness safety</em> (AS)
  and <em>con-freeness safety</em> (CFS).
  To measure the checks' effectiveness, we developed a novel approach
  to systematically test dynamic updates by forcing updates at
  each of the <em>update points</em> encountered during system test
  execution. To mitigate the
  increase in the number of tests, we developed an algorithm for
  <em>test suite minimization</em> which proved highly effective 
  in our experiments.  Using this approach, we
  systematically tested a series of dynamic patches to 
  OpenSSH, vsftpd and ngIRCd.  
  AS and CFS prevented most, but not all, dynamic update 
  failures;
  CFS allowed more failures than AS, but
  AS was more restrictive, disallowing many more successful updates.
  Our results show that neither AS nor CFS can be completely
  relied upon to produce correct dynamic updates, and our investigation
  points to the reasons why.
  Our work represents an important step, and important insights, toward
  developing safe, easy-to-use DSU systems.
