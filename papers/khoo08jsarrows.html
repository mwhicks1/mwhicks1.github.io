Event-driven programming in JavaScript often leads to code that
is messy and hard to maintain. We have found <em>arrows</em>, a generalization
of <em>monads</em>, to be an elegant solution to this problem. Our
arrow-based <em>Arrowlets</em> library makes it easy to compose eventdriven
programs in modular units of code. In particular, we show
how to implement <em>drag-and-drop</em> modularly using arrows.
