  abstract = {
In disaster and combat situations, mobile cameras
and other sensors transmit real-time data, used by
many operators and/or analysis tools. Unfortunately,
in the face of limited, unreliable resources, and varying demands, not all users may be able to get the  
fidelity they require. This paper describes MediaNet, a distributed multi-media processing system designed with the above scenarios in mind. Unlike past  
approaches, MediaNet's users can intuitively specify how the system should adapt based on their individual needs. MediaNet uses both local and on-line global resource scheduling to improve user performance and network utilization, and adapts without requiring underlying support for resource reservations. Performance experiments show that our 
scheduling algorithm is reasonably fast, and that user 
performance and network utilization are both significantly improved.
