  Quantitative information flow (QIF) is concerned with measuring
  how much of a secret is leaked to an adversary who observes the
  result of a computation that uses it. Prior work has shown that QIF
  techniques based on <em>abstract interpretation</em> with
  <em>probabilistic polyhedra</em> can be used to analyze the worst-case
  leakage of a query, on-line, to determine whether that query can be
  safely answered. While this approach can provide precise estimates,
  it does not scale well. This paper shows how to solve the
  scalability problem by augmenting the baseline technique with
  <em>sampling</em> and <em>symbolic execution</em>. We prove that our
  approach never underestimates a query's leakage (it is
  sound), and detailed experimental results show that we can
  match the precision of the baseline technique but with orders of
  magnitude better performance.
