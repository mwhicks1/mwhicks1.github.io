Interaction between entities who may not trust each other is now
commonplace on the Internet.
This paper focuses on the specific problem of sharing information
between distrusting parties.
Previous work in this area shows that <i>privacy</i> and <i>utility</i>
can co-exist, but often do not provide strong assurances of one or the other.
In this paper, we sketch a research agenda with several directions for
attacking these problems, considering several alternative systems that
examine the privacy vs. utility problem from different angles.
We consider new mechanisms such as economic incentives to share data
or discourage 
data leakage and a hybrid of code-splitting and secure multi-party
computation to provide various assurances of secrecy.
We discuss how to incorporate these mechanisms into practical applications,
including online social networks, a recommendation system based on users'
qualifications rather than identities, and a <em>personal information
broker</em> that monitors data leakage over time.
