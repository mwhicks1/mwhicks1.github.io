  Checked C is a new effort working toward a memory-safe C. Its design
  is distinguished from that of prior efforts by truly being an
  <em>extension</em> of C: Every C program is also a Checked C
  program. Thus, one may make incremental safety improvements to
  existing codebases while retaining backward compatibility. This
  paper makes two contributions. First, to help developers convert
  existing C code to use so-called <em>checked</em> (i.e., safe)
  pointers, we have developed a preliminary, automated porting tool. Notably, this
  tool takes advantage of the flexibility of Checked C's design: The
  tool need not perfectly classify every pointer, as required of prior
  all-or-nothing efforts. Rather, it can make a best effort to convert
  more pointers accurately, without letting inaccuracies inhibit
  compilation. However, such partial conversion raises the question:
  If safety violations can still occur, what sort of advantage does
  using Checked C provide? We draw inspiration from research on
  migratory typing to make our second contribution: We prove a
  <em>blame</em> property that renders so-called <em>checked regions</em>
  blameless of any run-time failure. We formalize this property for a
  core calculus and mechanize the proof in Coq.
