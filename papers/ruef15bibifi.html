There is currently little evidence about what tools, methods, processes, 
and languages lead to secure software. We present the experimental design 
of the Build it Break it secure programming contest as an aim to provide 
such evidence. The contest also provides education value to participants 
where they gain experience developing programs in an adversarial settings. 
We show preliminary results from previous runs of the contest that 
demonstrate the contest works as designed, and provides the data desired. 
We are in the process of scaling the contest to collect larger data sets 
with the goal of making statistically significant correlations between 
various factors of development and software security.
