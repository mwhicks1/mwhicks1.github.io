  Combining monadic computations may induce a significant syntactic overhead. 
  To allow monadic programming in direct style, we have developed Coco, a type-based tool that automatically rewrites ML code inserting necessary binds, unit, and morphisms between monads.
 This tool demonstration will show how to take advantage of Coco to facilitate using monadic libraries in practice, 
  and will discuss possible future development of Coco to fit the actual needs of programmers.
