Software updates typically require stopping and restarting an
application, but many systems cannot afford to halt service, or would
prefer not to.  <em>Dynamic software updating</em> (DSU) addresses this
difficulty by permitting programs to be updated while they run.  DSU
is appealing compared to other approaches for on-line upgrades because
it is quite general and requires no redundant hardware.  The challenge
is in making DSU <em>practical</em>: it should be flexible, and yet
safe, efficient, and easy to use.<p>
In this paper, we present Ginseng, a DSU implementation for C that aims to
meet this challenge.  We compile programs specially so that they can
be dynamically patched, and generate most of a dynamic patch
automatically.  Ginseng performs a series of analyses that when
combined with some simple runtime support ensure that an update will
not violate type-safety while guaranteeing that data is kept
up-to-date.  We have used Ginseng to construct and dynamically
apply patches to three substantial open-source server
programs---<em>Very Secure FTP daemon</em>, <em>OpenSSH sshd daemon</em>, and
<em>GNU Zebra</em>.  In total, we dynamically patched each program with
three years' worth of releases.  Though the programs changed
substantially, the majority of updates were easy to generate.
Performance experiments show that all patches could be applied in less
than 5 <em>ms</em>, and that the overhead on application throughput due to
updating support ranged from 0 to at most 32%.
