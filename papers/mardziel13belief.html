  papers.</font><p>
We present several techniques that aim to compute
the belief or knowledge a party might have about the values of hidden variables involved in the computation. These techniques can be used for enforcing knowledge-based security policies and for optimizing secure multiparty computations.<p>[&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mwh/papers/knowledge-overview.pdf">.pdf</a>&nbsp;]
