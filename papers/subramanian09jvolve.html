Software evolves to fix bugs and add features. Stopping and restarting
programs to apply changes is inconvenient and often costly.  Dynamic
software updating (DSU) addresses this problem by updating programs while
they execute, but existing DSU systems for managed languages do not support
many updates that occur in practice and are inefficient.  This paper
presents the design and implementation of Jvolve, a DSU-enhanced Java VM.
Updated programs may add, delete, and replace fields and methods anywhere
within the class hierarchy. Jvolve implements these updates by adding to
and coordinating VM classloading, just-in-time compilation, scheduling,
return barriers, on-stack replacement, and garbage collection. Jvolve is
safe: its use of bytecode verification and VM thread synchronization
ensures that an update will always produce type-correct executions. Jvolve
is flexible: it can support 20 of 22 updates to three open-source
programs---Jetty web server, JavaEmailServer, and CrossFTP server---based
on actual releases occurring over 1 to 2 years.  Jvolve is efficient:
performance experiments show that incurs no overhead during steady-state
execution.  These results demonstrate that this work is a significant step
towards practical support for dynamic updates in virtual machines for
managed languages.<p>[&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mwh/papers/jvolve.pdf">.pdf</a>&nbsp;]
