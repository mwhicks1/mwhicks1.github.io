  Security-typed languages promise to be a powerful tool with which
  provably secure software applications may be developed.  Programs
  written in these languages enforce a strong, global policy of
  <em>noninterference</em> which ensures that high-security data will
  not be observable on low-security channels.  Because noninterference
  is typically too strong a property, most programs use some form of
  <em>declassification</em> to selectively leak high security information,
  e.g. when performing a password check or data encryption.
  Unfortunately, such a declassification is often expressed as an
  operation within a given program, rather than as part of a global
  policy, making reasoning about the security implications of a policy
  more difficult.<p>
  In this paper, we propose a simple idea we call <i>trusted
  declassification</i> in which special <em>declassifier</em> functions are
  specified as part of the global policy.  In particular, individual
  principals declaratively specify which declassifiers they trust so
  that all information flows implied by the policy can be reasoned
  about in absence of a particular program.  We formalize our approach
  for a Java-like language and prove a modified form of
  noninterference which we call <em>noninterference modulo trusted methods</em>.  We have implemented
  our approach as an extension to Jif and provide some of our
  experience using it to build a secure e-mail client.
