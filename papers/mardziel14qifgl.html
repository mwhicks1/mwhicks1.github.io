Metrics for quantifying information leakage assume
  that an adversary's gain is the defender's loss.
  We demonstrate that this assumption does not always hold via a class
  of scenarios.
  We describe how to extend quantification to account for a defender
  with goals distinct from adversary failure.
  We implement the extension and experimentally explore the impact on
  the measured information leakage of the motivating scenario.
