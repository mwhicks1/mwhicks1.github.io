Many important applications must run continuously and without interruption,
yet must be changed to fix bugs or upgrade functionality.  No
prior general-purpose methodology for dynamic updating achieves a practical
balance between flexibility, robustness, low overhead, and ease of use.<p>
We present an approach for C-like languages that provides type-safe dynamic
updating of native code in an extremely flexible manner (code, data, and
types may be updated, at programmer-determined times) and permits the use of
automated tools to aid the programmer in the updating process.  Our system
is based on dynamic patches that contain both the updated code and the code
needed to transition from the old version to the new.  A novel aspect of our
patches is that they consist of verifiable native code (e.g. Proof-Carrying
Code or Typed Assembly Language), which is native code accompanied by
annotations that allow on-line verification of the code's safety.  We
discuss how patches are generated mostly automatically, how they are applied
using dynamic-linking technology, and how code is compiled to make it
updateable.<p>
To concretely illustrate our system, we have implemented a
dynamically-updateable web server, FlashEd.  We discuss our experience
building and maintaining FlashEd, and generalize to present observations
about updateable software development.  Performance experiments show that
for FlashEd, the overhead due to updating is low: typically less than 1
percent.
