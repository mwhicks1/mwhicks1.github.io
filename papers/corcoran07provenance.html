Provenance and security are intimately related. Cheney et
al. show that the dependencies underlying provenance
information also underly information flow security policies. Provenance
information can also play a role in history-based access control
policies.  Many real applications have the need to
combine a variety of security policies with provenance tracking. For
instance, an online stock trading website might restrict access to certain
premium features it offers using an access control policy, while at the same
time using an information flow policy to ensure that a user's sensitive
trading information is not leaked to other users. Similarly, the application
might need to track the provenance of transaction information to support an
annual financial audit while also using provenance to attest to the
reliability of stock analyses that it presents to its users.<p>
We have been exploring the interaction between provenance and security
policies while developing a document management system we call the
<em>Collaborative Planning Application</em> (CPA).  The CPA is written in
SELinks, our language for supporting user-defined, label-based security
policies. SELinks is an extension of the Links
web-programming language with means to express label-based
security policies.  Labels are associated with the data they protect by
using dependent types which, along with some syntactic restrictions, suffice
to ensure that user-defined policies enjoy <em>complete mediation</em> and
cannot be circumvented.  Our interest in provenance and
security policies is thus part of a broader exploration of how security
policies can be encoded, composed, and reasoned about within SELinks.  In
this paper, we describe the architecture of the CPA and its approach to
label-based provenance and security policies
and we sketch directions for further exploration on the interaction between
the two.
