  We present the <em>Measurement Manager Protocol</em> (MGRP),
  an in-kernel service that schedules and transmits probes
  on behalf of active measurement tools.  Unlike prior measurement
  services, MGRP transparently piggybacks application packets inside
  the often significant amounts of empty padding contained in typical
  probes.  Using MGRP thus combines the modularity, flexibility, and
  accuracy of standalone active measurement tools with the lower
  overhead of passive measurement techniques.  Microbenchmark experiments
  show that the resulting bandwidth savings makes it possible to
  measure the network accurately, but faster and more aggressively than
  without piggybacking, and with
  few ill effects to piggybacked application or competing
  traffic.  When using MGRP to schedule
  measurements on behalf of MediaNet, an overlay service
  that adaptively schedules media streams, we show MediaNet can achieve
  significantly higher streaming rates under the same network
  conditions.
