  Many researchers have proposed programming languages that
  support <em>incremental computation</em> (IC), which allows programs
  to be efficiently re-executed after a small change to the
  input. However, existing implementations of such languages have two
  important drawbacks. First, recomputation is oblivious to
  specific demands on the program output; that is, if a program input
  changes, all dependencies will be recomputed, even if an observer no
  longer requires certain outputs. Second, programs are made
  incremental as a unit, with little or no support for reusing
  results outside of their original context, e.g., when reordered. 
  To address these problems, we present lambdaCDDIC, a core calculus that applies
  a <em>demand-driven</em> semantics to incremental computation,
  tracking changes in a hierarchical fashion in a novel <em>demanded
    computation graph</em>. lambdaCDDIC also formalizes an explicit
  separation between inner, incremental computations and outer
  observers. This combination ensures lambdaCDDIC programs only recompute
  computations as demanded by observers, and allows inner computations
  to be composed more freely. We describe an algorithm for implementing
  lambdaCDDIC efficiently, and we present AdaptOn, a library for writing
  lambdaCDDIC-style programs in OCaml. We evaluated AdaptOn on a range of
  benchmarks, and found that it provides reliable speedups, and in
  many cases dramatically outperforms prior state-of-the-art IC approaches.
