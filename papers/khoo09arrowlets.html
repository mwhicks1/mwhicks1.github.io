  JavaScript programmers make extensive use of event-driven
  programming to help build responsive web applications. However,
  standard approaches to sequencing events are messy, and often lead
  to code that is difficult to understand and maintain. We have found
  that <em>arrows</em>, a generalization of <em>monads</em>, are an
  elegant solution to this problem. Arrows allow us to easily write
  asynchronous programs in small, modular units of code, and flexibly
  compose them in many different ways, while nicely abstracting the
  details of asynchronous program composition.  In this paper, we
  present Arrowlets, a new JavaScript library that offers arrows to
  the everyday JavaScript programmer. We show how to use Arrowlets to
  construct a variety of state machines, including state machines that
  branch and loop.  We also demonstrate how Arrowlets separate
  computation from composition with examples such as a drag-and-drop
  handler and a bubblesort animation.
