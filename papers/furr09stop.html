Ruby is a popular dynamic scripting language that permits
terse, expressive code, but provides no static checks to detect errors
before running the program. To address this, we have developed Diamondback
Ruby (DRuby), a tool that blends the beneﬁts of static and dynamic
typing. This paper brieﬂy describes the main features of DRuby, which
we will present in a tool demonstration. The presentation will concentrate
on the development of a small, statically typed Ruby program,
illustrating how DRuby might be used in practice. The audience will
learn about some of the practical design decisions that went into DRuby,
and how to use it to develop a type-safe Ruby program.<p>[&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mwh/papers/rubydemo.pdf">.pdf</a>&nbsp;]
