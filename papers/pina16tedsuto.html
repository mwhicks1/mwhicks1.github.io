  Dynamic software updating (DSU) is a technique for patching
  <em>running</em> programs, to fix bugs or add new features.
  DSU avoids the downtime of stop-and-restart updates, but creates new
  risks---an incorrect or ill-timed dynamic update could result in a
  crash or misbehavior, defeating the whole purpose of DSU . To
  reduce such risks, dynamic updates should be carefully
  tested before they are deployed.
  This paper presents Tedsuto, a general testing framework for DSU,
  along with a concrete implementation of it for Rubah, a state-of-the-art Java-based
  DSU system. Tedsuto uses system-level tests developed for the old
  and new versions of the updateable software, and systematically
  tests whether a dynamic update might result in a test
  failure. Very often this process is fully automated, while in some
  cases (e.g., to test new-version functionality) some manual
  annotations are required. 
  To evaluate Tedsuto's efficacy, we applied it to dynamic
  updates previously developed (and tested in an ad hoc manner) for
  the H2 SQL database server and the CrossFTP server--- two
  real-world, multithreaded systems.  We used three large test suites, totalling
  446 tests, and we found a variety of
  update-related bugs in short order, and at low cost.
