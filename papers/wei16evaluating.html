  Static analysis techniques for reasoning about numeric data are important for applications such as array bounds checking and resource usage estimation.
Applying these techniques to real-world Java programs also requires handling important language features such as dynamic memory allocation and method calls.
However, designing a scalable analysis that handles such features presents a multitude of choices, each of which may interact with the others. For example, we could use top-down or a bottom-up interprocedural analysis, and this choice could interact with how we choose to represent aliasing in the heap and/or whether we use a relational numeric domain, e.g., convex polyhedra.
In this paper, we present a family of static numeric analyses for Java and systematically evaluate the impact 216 analysis configurations on a small benchmark suite considering precision, performance, and their tradeoff.
The core of our analysis family-the combination handling numeric data, a heap abstraction, and method calls-is new, while the remaining configuration options are drawn from the literature.
We find that the best overall precision/performance tradeoff is made by bottom-up analysis with a hybrid relational/non-relational numeric domain and special handling of strings. However, other configurations offer advantages in particular cases.
