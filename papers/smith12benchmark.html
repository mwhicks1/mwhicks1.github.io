  Dynamic Software Updating (DSU) has been an active topic of research
  for at least the last 30 years. However, despite many recent
  advances, DSU has yet to see widespread adoption and deployment in
  practice. In this paper, we review a slice of the history of DSU
  research to study how DSU for C has evolved over the last two
  decades. We examine the ways DSU systems are
  evaluated in the research literature. We identify several
  shortcomings of the evaluation criteria that have been used, and
  propose key improvements. We believe that using better evaluation
  criteria can guide DSU research to produce systems that will
  be more practical, flexible, and usable.
