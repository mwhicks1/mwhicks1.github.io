  Numeric static analysis for Java has a broad range of potentially
  useful applications, including array bounds checking and resource
  usage estimation. However, designing a scalable numeric static
  analysis for real-world Java programs presents a multitude of design
  choices, each of which may interact with others. For example, an
  analysis could handle method calls via either a top-down or
  bottom-up interprocedural analysis. Moreover, this choice could
  interact with how we choose to represent aliasing in the heap and/or
  whether we use a relational numeric domain, e.g., convex polyhedra.
  In this paper, we present a family of abstract interpretation-based
  numeric static analyses for Java and systematically evaluate the
  impact of 162 analysis configurations on the DaCapo benchmark
  suite. Our experiment considered the precision and performance of
  the analyses for discharging array bounds checks. We found that
  top-down analysis is generally a better choice than bottom-up
  analysis, and that using access paths to describe heap objects is
  better than using summary objects corresponding to points-to
  analysis locations. Moreover, these two choices are the most
  significant, while choices about the numeric domain, representation
  of abstract objects, and context-sensitivity make much less
  difference to the precision/performance tradeoff.
