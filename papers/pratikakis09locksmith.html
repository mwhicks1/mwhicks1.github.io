  Locksmith is a static analysis tool for automatically detecting
  data races in C programs.  In this paper, we describe each of
  Locksmith's component analyses precisely, and present systematic
  measurements that isolate interesting tradeoffs between precision
  and efficiency in each analysis.  Using a benchmark suite comprising
  standalone applications and Linux device drivers totaling more than
  200,000 lines of code, we found that a simple no-worklist strategy
  yielded the most efficient interprocedural dataflow analysis; that
  our sharing analysis was able to determine that most locations are
  thread-local, and therefore need not be protected by locks; that
  modeling C structs and void pointers precisely is key to both
  precision and efficiency; and that context-sensitivity yields a much
  more precise analysis, though with decreased scalability.  Put
  together, our results illuminate some of the key engineering
  challenges in building Locksmith and data race detection analyses
  in particular, and constraint-based program analyses in general.
