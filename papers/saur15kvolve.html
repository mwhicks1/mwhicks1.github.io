  NoSQL
  databases like Redis, Cassandra, and MongoDB are
  increasingly popular because they are flexible, lightweight, and
  easy to work with. Applications that use these databases
  will evolve over time, sometimes necessitating (or preferring) a change
  to the format or organization of the data. The problem we address in this paper is:
  How can we support the evolution of high-availability applications
  and their NoSQL data <em>online</em>, without excessive delays or
  interruptions, even in the presence of backward-incompatible
  data format changes?<P>
We present KVolve, an extension to the popular Redis NoSQL database, as a
  solution to this problem. KVolve permits a developer to
  submit an upgrade specification that defines how to
  transform existing data to the newest version. This transformation
  is applied <em>lazily</em> as applications interact with the
  database, thus avoiding long pause times. We demonstrate that KVolve is
  expressive enough to support substantial practical updates,
  including format changes to RedisFS, a Redis-backed file system,
  while imposing essentially no overhead in general use and minimal
  pause times during updates.
