  Justin McCann and Michael Hicks, October 2011.</font><p>
Transient network stalls that degrade application performance are frustrating to
users and developers alike. Software bugs, network congestion, and intermittent
connectivity all have the same symptoms-low throughput, high latency, and
user-level timeouts. In this paper, we show how an end host can identify the
sources of network stalls using only simple counters from its local network stack.
By viewing the network stack as a producer-consumer dependency graph and
monitoring its activity as a whole, our rule-based expert system correctly
identifies which modules are hampering performance over 99% of the time, with
false positive rates under 3%.  The result is a network stack trace-a
lightweight snapshot of the end host's networking stack that describes the
behavior of each application, socket, connection, and interface.
