  We present the design and implementation of the first complete framework
  for flexible and safe dynamic linking of native code.  Our approach
  extends Typed Assembly Language with a primitive for loading and
  typechecking code, which is flexible enough to support a variety of
  linking strategies, but simple enough that it does not significantly
  expand the trusted computing base.  Using this primitive, along with the
  ability to compute with types, we show that we can <em>program</em> many
  existing dynamic linking approaches.  As a concrete demonstration, we have
  used our framework to implement dynamic linking for a type-safe dialect of
  C, closely modeled after the standard linking facility for Unix C
  programs.  Aside from the unavoidable cost of verification, our
  implementation performs comparably with the standard, untyped approach.
