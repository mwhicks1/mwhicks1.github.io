We describe work in progress that uses program analysis to show that
security-critical programs, such as cross-domain guards, correctly
enforce cross-domain security policies.
We are enhancing existing techniques from the field of
security-oriented programming languages to construct a new language
for the construction of secure networked applications, <em>SELinks</em>.
In order to specify and enforce expressive and fine-grained policies,
we advocate dynamically associating security labels with sensitive
entities.
Programs written in <em>SELinks</em> are statically guaranteed to
correctly manipulate an entity's security labels and to ensure that
the appropriate policy checks mediate all operations that are
performed on the entity.
We discuss the design of our main case study: a web-based
collaborative planning application that will permit a collection
of users, with varying security requirements and clearances, to access
sensitive data sources and collaboratively create documents based on
these sources.
