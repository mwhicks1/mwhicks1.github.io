  Software transactions allow the programmer to specify sections of
  code that should be serializable, without the programmer needing to
  worry about exactly how atomicity is enforced.  Recent research
  proposes using optimistic concurrency to implement transactions.  In
  this short paper, we propose a pessimistic lock-based technique that
  uses the results of static whole-program analysis to enforce
  atomicity.  The input to our analysis is a program that contains
  programmer-specified atomic sections and calls to fork.  We present
  a sharing inference algorithm that uses the results of points-to
  analysis to determine which memory locations are shared.  Our
  analysis uses <em>continuation effects</em> to track the locations
  accessed after a point in the program.  This allows data to be
  thread-local before a fork and thread-shared afterward.  We then 
  present a mutex inference algorithm that determines a sufficient set
  of locks to guard accesses to shared locations.  After mutex
  inference, a compiler adds the appropriate lock acquires and
  releases to the beginning and end of atomic sections.  Our algorithm
  is efficient, and provides parallelism according to precision of the
  alias analysis while minimizing the number of required locks.
