  Many researchers have proposed programming languages that
  support <em>incremental computation</em> (IC), which allows programs
  to be efficiently re-executed after a small change to the
  input. However, existing implementations of such languages have two
  important drawbacks. First, recomputation is oblivious to
  specific demands on the program output; that is, if a program input
  changes, all dependencies will be recomputed, even if an observer no
  longer requires certain outputs. Second, programs are made
  incremental as a unit, with little or no support for reusing
  results outside of their original context, e.g., when reordered. <p>
  To address these problems, we present 位<sup>CDD</sup><sub>IC</sub>, a core calculus that
  applies a <em>demand-driven</em> semantics to incremental computation,
  tracking changes in a hierarchical fashion in a novel <em>demanded
    computation graph</em>. 位<sup>CDD</sup><sub>IC</sub> also formalizes an explicit separation
  between inner, incremental computations and outer observers. This
  combination ensures 位<sup>CDD</sup><sub>IC</sub> programs only recompute computations as
  demanded by observers, and allows inner computations to be reused
  more liberally. We present Adapton, an OCaml library implementing
  位<sup>CDD</sup><sub>IC</sub>. We evaluated Adapton on a range of benchmarks, and found
  that it provides reliable speedups, and in many cases dramatically
  outperforms state-of-the-art IC approaches.
