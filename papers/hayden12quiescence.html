  Dynamic software updating (DSU) techniques show great promise in
  allowing vital software services to be upgraded without downtime,
  avoiding dropped connections and the loss of critical program state.
  For multithreaded programs, DSU systems must balance
  <em>correctness</em> and <em>timeliness</em>.  To simplify reasoning
  that an update is correct, we could limit updates to take place only
  when all threads have blocked at well-defined <em>update
    points</em>.  However, several researchers have pointed out that this
  approach poses the risk of delaying an update for too long, even
  indefinitely, and therefore have developed fairly complicated
  mechanisms to mitigate the risk.  This paper argues that such
  mechanisms are unnecessary by demonstrating empirically that 
  many multithreaded programs can be updated
  with minimal delay using only a small number of manually annotated
  update points.  Our study of the time taken for all of the
  threads in six real-world, event-driven programs to reach
  their update points ranged from 0.155 to 107.558 ms,
  and most were below 1 ms.
