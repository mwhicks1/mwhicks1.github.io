<font size="+1"><b>Dynamic Software Updates for Java: A VM-Centric Approach</b>.

Software evolves to fix bugs and add features, but stopping and
restarting existing programs to take advantage of these changes can be
inconvenient and costly.  Dynamic software updating (DSU) addresses
these problems by updating programs while they run.  The challenge is
to develop DSU infrastructure that is flexible, safe, and
efficient-DSU should enable updates that are likely to occur in
practice, and updated programs should be as reliable and as efficient
as those started from scratch.
  
This paper presents the design and implementation of a JVM we call
Jvolve that is enhanced with DSU support.  The paper's key insight is
that flexible, safe, and efficient DSU can be supported by naturally
extending existing VM services.  By piggybacking on classloading and
garbage collection, Jvolve can flexibly support additions and
replacements of fields and methods anywhere within the class
hierarchy, and in a manner that may alter class signatures.  By
utilizing bytecode verification and thread synchronization support,
Jvolve can ensure that an applied update will never violate type
safety.  Finally, by employing JIT compilation, all DSU-related
overhead before or after an update can be effectively eliminated.
Using Jvolve, we successfully applied dynamic continuous updates
corresponding to 20 of the 22 releases that occurred over nearly two
years' time, one update per release, for three open-source programs,
Jetty web server, JavaEmailServer, and CrossFTP server.  Our results
indicate that the VM is well-suited to support practical DSU services.
