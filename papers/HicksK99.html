Active Networks promise greater flexibility than current networks, but
threaten safety and security by virtue of their programmability. In this
paper, we describe the design and implementation of a security architecture
for the active network <em>PLANet</em>.  Security is obtained
with a two-level architecture that combines a functionally restricted packet
language, PLAN, with an environment of general-purpose
service routines governed by <em>trust management</em>.  In
particular, we employ a technique which expands or contracts a packet's
service environment based on its level of privilege, termed <em>
namespace-based security</em>.  As an application of our security architecture,
we present the design and implementation of an active-network firewall. We
find that the addition of the firewall imposes around a 30 percent latency
overhead, and as little as a 6.7 percent space overhead to incoming packets.
