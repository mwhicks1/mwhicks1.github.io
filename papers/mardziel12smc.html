Protocols for <em>secure multiparty computation</em> (SMC) allow a set
of mutually distrusting parties to compute a function&nbsp;<em>f</em> of their
private inputs while revealing nothing about their inputs beyond what
is implied by the result.  Depending on&nbsp;<em>f</em>, however, the result
itself may reveal more information than parties are comfortable with.
Almost all previous work on SMC treats <em>f</em> as given.  Left unanswered
is the question of how parties should decide whether it is &ldquo;safe&rdquo;
for them to compute <em>f</em> in the first place.<p>
We propose here a way to apply <em>belief tracking</em> to&nbsp;SMC in order
to address exactly this question. In our approach, each participating
party is able to reason about the increase in knowledge that other
parties could gain as a result of computing <em>f</em>, and may choose not to
participate (or participate only partially) so as to restrict that
gain in knowledge.  We develop two techniques---the <em>belief set</em>
method and the <em>SMC belief tracking</em> method---prove them sound,
and discuss their precision/performance tradeoffs using a series of
experiments.
