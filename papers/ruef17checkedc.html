  This paper presents Checked C, an extension to C designed to support
  spatial safety, implemented in Clang and LLVM. Checked C's design is
  distinguished by its focus on backward-compatibility, developer
  usability, and enabling highly performant code. Like past approaches
  to a safer C, Checked C employs a form of <em>checked pointer</em>
  whose accesses can be statically or dynamically verified. New to Checked C is the
  notion of a <em>checked region</em>. Inspired by the <em>blame
    theorem</em> from <em>gradual typing</em>, checked regions can be held
  blameless as the source of a safety violation, meaning it must have arisen
  from unchecked code. We formalize and prove this property using the
  Coq proof assistant. To
  assist programmers in migrating legacy code to Checked C, we have
  implemented a porting tool that introduces the use of checked
  pointers, where safe. Experiments on standard benchmarks and some
  legacy programs show that Checked C generates efficient code, and
  that the porting tool is useful.
