The Internet protocols were designed to emphasize simple rout-
ing elements and intelligent hosts. However, there are applications
that benefit from allowing hosts to customize or program routers, a
concept known as active networking. Since routers are shared, this
raises challenges with delivering sufficient flexibility while preserving
or improving performance, security, and safety. PLAN (Packet Lan-
guage for Active Networks) is a language designed for the SwitchWare
active network architecture. This architecture comprises active pack-
ets containing PLAN programs that invoke service routines over an
active OS. PLAN is based on the polymorphic lambda calculus and
provides a restricted set of primitives and datatypes that enables rea-
soning about its impact on network resources based on features of the
language design. This paper focuses on the PLAN language with the
aim of consolidating a variety of studies that were carried out in the
years after its introduction in 1998. These studies include the require-
ments for PLAN, its design, programming in PLAN, the specification
and theory of PLAN, and its use in networking applications.
