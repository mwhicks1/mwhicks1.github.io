  Dynamic software updating (DSU) systems patch programs
  on the fly without incurring downtime.
  To avoid failures due to the updating process itself, 
  many DSU systems employ <em>timing restrictions</em>.
  However, timing restrictions are theoretically
  imperfect, and their practical effectiveness is an open question.<p>
  This paper presents the first significant empirical evaluation of
  three popular timing restrictions: <em>activeness safety</em> (AS),
  which prevents updates to active functions;
  <em>con-freeness safety</em> (CFS), which only allows modifications to
  active functions when doing so is provably type-safe; and
  <em>manual identification</em> of the event-handling loops during which an
  update may occur.<p>
  We evaluated these timing restrictions using a series of DSU patches
  to three programs:
  OpenSSH, vsftpd, and ngIRCd.  We systematically applied
  updates at each distinct update point reached during execution of 
  a suite of system tests for these programs
  to determine which updates pass and which fail.
  We found that all
  three timing restrictions prevented most
  failures, but only manual identification allowed none.  Further,
   although CFS and AS allowed many
  more update points, manual identification
  still supported updates with minimal delay.  Finally, 
  we found that manual identification required the least developer effort.
  Overall, we conclude that manual identification is most effective.
