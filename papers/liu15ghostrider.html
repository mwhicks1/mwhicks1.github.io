This paper presents a new, co-designed compiler and architecture
called GhostRider for supporting privacy preserving computation in the
cloud. GhostRider ensures all programs satisfy a property called
memory-trace obliviousness (MTO): Even an adversary that observes
memory, bus traffic, and access times while the program executes can
learn nothing about the program's sensitive inputs and outputs. One
way to achieve MTO is employ Oblivious RAM (ORAM), allocating all code
and data in a single ORAM bank, and to also disable caches or fix the
rate of memory traffic. This baseline approach can be inefficient, and
so GhostRider's compiler uses a program analysis to do better,
allocating data to non-oblivious, encrypted RAM (ERAM) and employing a
scratchpad when doing so will not compromise MTO . The compiler can
also allocate to multiple ORAM banks, which sometimes significantly
reduces access times. We have formalized our approach and proved it
enjoys MTO . Our FPGA-based hardware prototype and simulation results
show that GhostRider significantly outperforms the baseline strategy.
