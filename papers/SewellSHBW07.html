    Most programming languages adopt static binding, but for distributed
programming an exclusive reliance on static binding is too
restrictive: dynamic binding is required in various guises, for
example when a marshalled value is received from the network,
containing identifiers that must be rebound to local resources.
Typically it is provided only by ad-hoc mechanisms that lack clean
semantics.<p>
    In this paper we adopt a foundational approach, developing core
dynamic rebinding mechanisms as extensions to the simply-typed
call-by-value lambda-calculus.  To do so we must first explore
refinements of the call-by-value reduction strategy that delay
instantiation, to ensure computations make use of the most recent
versions of rebound definitions.  We introduce redex-time and
destruct-time strategies.  The latter forms the basis for a
lambda-marsh calculus that supports dynamic rebinding of marshalled
values, while remaining as far as possible statically-typed.  We
sketch an extension of lambda-marsh with concurrency and
communication, giving examples showing how wrappers for encapsulating
untrusted code can be expressed.  Finally, we show that a high-level
semantics for dynamic updating can also be based on the destruct-time
strategy, defining a lambda-update calculus with simple primitives to
provide type-safe updating of running code.  We show how the ideas of
this simple calculus extend to more real-world, module-level dynamic
updating in the style of Erlang.  We thereby establish primitives and
a common semantic foundation for a variety of real-world dynamic
rebinding requirements.
