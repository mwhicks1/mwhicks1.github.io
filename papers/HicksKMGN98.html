PLAN (Packet Language for Active Networks) is a new language for
programs that form the packets of a programmable network.  These
programs replace the packet headers (which can be viewed as very
rudimentary programs) used in current networks.  As such, PLAN
programs are lightweight and of restricted functionality.  These
limitations are mitigated by allowing PLAN code to call node-resident
<em>service routines</em> written in other, more powerful languages.
This two-level architecture, in which PLAN serves as a scripting or
`glue' language for more general services, is the primary contribution
of this paper. We have successfully applied the PLAN programming
environment to implement an IP-free internetwork.<p>
PLAN is based on the simply typed lambda calculus and provides a
restricted set of primitives and datatypes.  PLAN defines a special
construct called a <em>chunk</em> used to describe the remote execution
of PLAN programs on other nodes. Primitive operations on chunks are
used to provide basic data transport in the network and to support
layering of protocols.  Remote execution can make debugging difficult,
so PLAN provides strong static guarantees to the programmer, such as
type safety.  A more novel property aimed at protecting network
availability is a guarantee that PLAN programs use a bounded amount of
network resources.<p>[&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~switchware/papers/plan.ps">.ps</a>&nbsp;]
