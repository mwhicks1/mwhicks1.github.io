  Quantum algorithms often apply classical operations, such as
  arithmetic or predicate checks, over a quantum superposition of
  classical data; these so-called <em>oracles</em> are often the largest
  components of a quantum program. To ease the construction of
  efficient, correct oracle functions, this paper presents VQO, a
  high-assurance framework implemented with the Coq proof
  assistant. The core of VQO is OQASM, the <em>oracle
  quantum assembly language</em>. OQASM operations move qubits between
  two different bases via the quantum
  Fourier transform, thus admitting important optimizations, but
  without inducing <em>entanglement</em> and the exponential blowup that
  comes with it. OQASM's design enabled us to prove
  correct VQO's compilers---from a simple imperative language called
  OQIMP to OQASM, and from OQASM to SQIR, a general-purpose quantum
  assembly language---and allowed us to efficiently test properties of
  OQASM programs using the QuickChick property-based testing
  framework.
    We have used VQO to implement a variety of arithmetic and geometric operators
  that are building blocks for important oracles, including those used in Shor's and Grover's algorithms.
  We found that VQO's QFT-based arithmetic oracles require fewer qubits, sometimes substantially fewer, than those constructed using &ldquo;classical&rdquo; gates; VQO's versions of the latter were nevertheless on par with or better than (in terms of both qubit and gate counts) oracles produced by Quipper, a state-of-the-art but unverified quantum programming platform.
