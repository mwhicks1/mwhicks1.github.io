  There have been several efforts to bring static type
  inference to object-oriented dynamic languages such as Ruby, Python,
  and Perl.  In our experience, however, such type inference systems
  are extremely difficult to develop, because dynamic languages are
  typically complex, poorly specified, and include
  features, such as <tt>eval</tt> and reflection, that are hard to
  analyze.  In this paper, we introduce 
  <em>constraint-based dynamic type inference</em>, a technique that
  infers static types based on dynamic program executions.  In our approach,
  we wrap each run-time value to associate it with a type variable,
  and the wrapper generates constraints on this type variable when
  the wrapped value is used.  This technique avoids many of the often
  overly conservative approximations of static tools,
  as constraints
  are generated based on how values are used during actual program runs.
  Using wrappers is also easy to implement, since we need only
  write a constraint resolution algorithm and a transformation to
  introduce the wrappers.
  The best part is that we can eat our
  cake, too: our algorithm will infer <em>sound</em> types as long as it
  observes every 
  path through each method body-note that the number of such paths
  may be dramatically smaller than the number of paths through the
  program as a whole.  We have developed Rubydust, an implementation of
  our algorithm for Ruby.  Rubydust takes advantage of Ruby's dynamic
  features to implement wrappers as a language library.  We applied
  Rubydust to a number of small programs.  We found it to be
  lightweight and useful: Rubydust discovered 1 real type error,
  and all other inferred types were correct, and readable.
