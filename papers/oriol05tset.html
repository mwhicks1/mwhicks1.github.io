A simple and effective way of coordinating distributed, mobile, and
parallel applications is to use a virtual shared memory (VSM), such as
a Linda tuple-space.  In this paper, we propose a new kind of VSM,
called a <em>tagged set</em>.  Each element in the VSM is a value with
an associated tag, and values are read or removed from the VSM by
matching the tag.  Tagged sets exhibit three properties useful for
VSMs:
<p><ol>
<em>Ease of use</em>. A tagged value naturally corresponds to the
  notion that data has certain attributes, expressed by the tag, which
  can be used for later retrieval.<p>
<em>Flexibility</em>. Tags are implemented as propositional logic
  formulae, and selection as logical implication, so the resulting
  system is quite powerful.  Tagged sets naturally support a variety
  of applications, such as shared data repositories (e.g., for media
  or e-mail), message passing, and publish/subscribe algorithms;
  they are powerful enough to encode existing VSMs,
  such as Linda spaces.<p>
<em>Security</em>.  Our notion of tags naturally corresponds to
  keys, or capabilities: a user may not select data in the set unless
  she presents a legal key or keys.  Normal tags correspond to
  symmetric keys, and we introduce <em>asymmetric tags</em> that
  correspond to public and private key pairs.  Treating tags as keys
  permits users to easily specify protection criteria for data at a
  fine granularity.

This paper motivates our approach, sketches its basic theory, and
places it in the context of other data management strategies.
