                  security critical bugs in real software. Recently,
                  researchers have devoted significant effort to
                  devising new fuzzing techniques, strategies, and
                  algorithms. Such new ideas are primarily evaluated
                  experimentally so an important question is: What
                  experimental setup is needed to produce trustworthy
                  results? We surveyed the recent research literature
                  and assessed the experimental evaluations carried
                  out by 32 fuzzing papers. We found problems in every
                  evaluation we considered. We then performed our own
                  extensive experimental evaluation using an existing
                  fuzzer. Our results showed that the general problems
                  we found in existing experimental evaluations can
                  indeed translate to actual wrong or misleading
                  assessments. We conclude with some guidelines that
                  we hope will help improve experimental evaluations
                  of fuzz testing algorithms, making reported results
                  more robust.<p>[&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09700">http</a>&nbsp;]
