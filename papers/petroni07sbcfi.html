This paper presents a new approach to dynamically monitoring operating
system kernel integrity, based on a property called <em>state-based
control-flow integrity</em> (SBCFI).  Violations of SBCFI signal a
persistent, unexpected modification of the kernel's control-flow
graph.  We performed a thorough analysis of 25 Linux rootkits and
found that 24 (96%) employ persistent control-flow modifications; an
informal study of Windows rootkits yielded similar results.  We have
implemented SBCFI enforcement as part of the Xen and VMware virtual
machine monitors.  Our implementation detected all the control-flow
modifying rootkits we could install, while imposing unnoticeable
overhead for both a typical web server workload and CPU-intensive
workloads when operating at 10 second intervals.
