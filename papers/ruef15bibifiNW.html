 <em>The Next Wave</em>, 21(1):19--23, 2015.</font><p> We have a long legacy of failing to build secure
                  systems; can a coding competition give us insight
                  into what we can do better? This article presents an
                  overview of the Build-it, Break-it, Fix-it
                  Security-oriented programming competition.  <p>[&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nsa.gov/resources/everyone/digital-media-center/publications/the-next-wave/assets/files/TNW-21-1.pdf">.pdf</a>&nbsp;]
