  This paper presents SELinks, a programming language focused on
  building secure multi-tier web applications.  SELinks provides a
  uniform programming model, in the style of LINQ and Ruby on Rails,
  with language syntax for accessing objects residing either in the
  database or at the server.  Object-level security policies are
  expressed as fully-customizable, first-class <em>labels</em> which may
  themselves be subject to security policies.  Access to labeled data
  is mediated via trusted, user-provided <em>policy enforcement</em>
  functions.<p>
  SELinks has two novel features that ensure security policies are
  enforced correctly and efficiently.  First, SELinks implements a
   type system called Fable that allows a protected
  object's type to refer to its protecting label. The type
  system can check that labeled data is never accessed directly by the
  program without first consulting the appropriate policy
  enforcement function.  Second, SELinks compiles policy enforcement
  code to database-resident user-defined functions that can be
  called directly during query processing.  Database-side checking
  avoids transferring data to the server needlessly, while still
  allowing policies to be expressed in a customizable and portable
  manner.<p>
  Our experience with two sizable web applications, a model
  health-care database and a secure wiki with fine-grained security
  policies, indicates that cross-tier policy enforcement in SELinks
  is flexible, relatively easy to use, and, when compared to a
  single-tier approach, improves throughput by nearly an order of
  magnitude. SELinks is freely available.
