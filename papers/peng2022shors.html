Quantum computing technology may soon deliver revolutionary improvements in
algorithmic performance, but these are only useful if computed answers are
correct. While hardware-level decoherence errors have garnered significant
attention, a less recognized obstacle to correctness is that of human
programming errors -- "bugs". Techniques familiar to most programmers from the
classical domain for avoiding, discovering, and diagnosing bugs do not easily
transfer, at scale, to the quantum domain because of its unique
characteristics. To address this problem, we have been working to adapt formal
methods to quantum programming. With such methods, a programmer writes a
mathematical specification alongside their program, and semi-automatically
proves the program correct with respect to it. The proof's validity is
automatically confirmed -- certified -- by a "proof assistant". Formal methods
have successfully yielded high-assurance classical software artifacts, and the
underlying technology has produced certified proofs of major mathematical
theorems. As a demonstration of the feasibility of applying formal methods to
quantum programming, we present the first formally certified end-to-end
implementation of Shor's prime factorization algorithm, developed as part of a
novel framework for applying the certified approach to general applications. By
leveraging our framework, one can significantly reduce the effects of human
errors and obtain a high-assurance implementation of large-scale quantum
applications in a principled way.
