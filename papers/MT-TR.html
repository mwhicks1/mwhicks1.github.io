This paper presents a generalization of standard effect systems that
we call <em>contextual effects</em>.  A traditional effect system
computes the effect of an expression <em>e</em>.  Our system additionally
computes the effects of the computational context in which <em>e</em> occurs:
both the effect of the computation that has already occurred
(<em>prior effects</em>) and the effect of the computation yet to take
place (<em>future effects</em>).<p>
Contextual effects can be used in any application in which the past or
future computation of the program is relevant at various program points.  We
present two substantial examples.  First, we show how prior and future
effects can be used to enforce <em>transactional version consistency</em>
(TVC), a novel correctness property for dynamic software updates. TVC
ensures that programmer-designated transactional code blocks appear to
execute entirely at the same code version, even if a dynamic update occurs
in the middle of the block.  Second, we show how future effects can be used
in the analysis of multi-threaded programs to find thread-shared locations.
This is an essential step in applications such as data race detection.
