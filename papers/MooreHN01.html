We present SNAP (Safe and Nimble Active Packets), a new scheme for
programmable (or <em>active</em>) packets centered around a new low-level
packet language. Unlike previous active packet approaches, SNAP is <em>
practical</em>: namely, adding significant <em>flexibility</em> over IP without
compromising <em>safety and security</em> or <em>efficiency</em>. In this work we
compare SNAP's flexibility to other active packet systems, give proof
sketches of its novel approach to resource control, and present experimental
data showing SNAP attains performance extremely close to that of a software
IP router.
