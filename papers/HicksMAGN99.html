We present <em>PLANet</em>: an active network architecture and
implementation.  In addition to a standard suite of Internet-like
services, PLANet has two key programmability features:
<p><ol>
all packets contain programs
router functionality may be extended dynamically
</ol>
Packet programs are written in our special purpose programming
language PLAN, the Packet Language for Active Networks, while dynamic
router extensions are written in OCaml, a dialect of ML.<p>
Currently, PLANet routers run as byte-code-interpreted Linux
user-space applications, and support Ethernet and IP as link layers.
PLANet achieves respectable performance on standard networking
operations: on 300&nbsp;MHz Pentium-II's attached to 100&nbsp;Mbps Ethernet,
PLANet can route 48&nbsp;Mbps and switch over 5000 packets per second.  We
demonstrate the utility of PLANet's activeness by showing
experimentally how it can non-trivially improve application and
aggregate network performance in congested conditions.<p>[&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~switchware/papers/planet.ps">.ps</a>&nbsp;]
