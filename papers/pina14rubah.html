  This paper presents Rubah, the first <em>dynamic software
    updating</em> system for Java that: is portable, implemented via
  libraries and bytecode rewriting on top of a standard JVM; is
  efficient, imposing essentially no overhead on normal, steady-state execution; is
  flexible, allowing nearly arbitrary changes to classes between updates; and
  is non-disruptive, employing either a novel <em>eager</em> algorithm
  that transforms the program state with multiple threads, or a novel
  <em>lazy</em> algorithm that transforms objects as they are demanded,
  post-update. Requiring little programmer effort, Rubah has been used
  to dynamically update five
  long-running applications: the H2 database, the
  Voldemort key-value store, the Jake2 implementation of the Quake
  2 shooter game, the CrossFTP server, and the JavaEmailServer.
