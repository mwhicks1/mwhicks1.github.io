Most programming languages adopt static binding, but for distributed
programming an exclusive reliance on static binding is too
restrictive: dynamic binding is required in various guises.  Typically
it is provided only by ad-hoc mechanisms that lack clean semantics.
In this paper we adopt a more foundational approach, showing how core
dynamic rebinding mechanisms can be added to a CBV &lambda;-calculus.
To do so we first develop two refinements of the CBV reduction
strategy with delayed instantiation, the <em>redex-time</em> and
<em>destruct-time</em> semantics.  Delayed instantiation ensures we
obtain the most recent version of a definition following a rebinding.
The destruct-time semantics gives the basis for a &lambda;_marsh calculus
that supports dynamic rebinding, with primitives to package values and
<em>marks</em> to control which identifiers are dynamically rebound when
they are unpackaged.  We extend &lambda;_marsh with concurrency and
communication, giving examples showing how wrappers for encapsulating
untrusted code can be expressed, and discuss the extent to which it
can be statically typed.  Finally, we use the destruct-time semantics
also as a basis for a &lambda;_update calculus with simple primitives to
provide type-safe, dynamic updating of code.  We thereby put a variety
of real-world mechanisms on a common semantic foundation.
