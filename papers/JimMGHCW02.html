  Cyclone is a safe dialect of C .  It has been designed from the
  ground up to prevent the buffer overflows, format string attacks,
  and memory management errors that are common in C programs, while
  retaining C's syntax and semantics.  This paper examines safety
  violations enabled by C's design, and shows how Cyclone avoids them,
  without giving up C's hallmark control over low-level details such
  as data representation and memory management.
