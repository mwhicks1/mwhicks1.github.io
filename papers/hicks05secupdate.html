Applications that manipulate sensitive information should ensure
<em>end-to-end</em> security by satisfying two properties:
<em>sound execution</em> and some form of <em>noninterference</em>.  By
the former, we mean the program should always perform actions in
keeping with its current policy, and by the latter we mean that these
actions should never cause high-security information to be visible to
a low-security observer.  Over the last decade, security-typed
languages have been developed that exhibit these properties,
increasingly improving so as to model important features of real
programs.
No current security-typed language, however, permits general changes
to security policies in use by running programs.  This paper presents
a simple information flow type system that allows for dynamic
security policy updates while ensuring sound execution and a relaxed
form of noninterference we term
<em>noninterference between updates</em>.  We see this work as an
important step toward using language-based techniques to ensure
end-to-end security for realistic applications.
