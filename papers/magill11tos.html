  Dynamic software updating (DSU) systems eliminate costly downtime by
  dynamically fixing bugs and adding features to executing programs.
  Given a static *code* patch, most DSU systems can construct the
  run-time code changes automatically.  However, a dynamic update must
  also specify how to change the running program's execution *state*,
  e.g., its stack and heap, to be compatible with the new code.
  Constructing such *state transformations* correctly and
  automatically remains an open problem.  This paper presents a
  solution called Targeted Object Synthesis (TOS).  TOS first executes
  the same tests on the old and new program versions separately,
  observing the program state at key points.  Given two corresponding
  states, TOS *matches* corresponding objects between the two
  versions, and *synthesizes* the simplest-possible function to
  transform old version objects to their corresponding new versions.
  We show the efficacy of TOS by inferring transformation functions
  for actual updates to four open-source server programs.
