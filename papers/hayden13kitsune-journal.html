Dynamic software updating (DSU) systems facilitate software updates to
running programs, thereby permitting developers to add features and
fix bugs without downtime. This paper introduces Kitsune, a DSU
system for C that updates the whole program, rather than individual
functions. Kitsune makes the important aspects of updating explicit in the program text,
making the program's semantics easy to
understand. The programmer can write simple specifications
to direct Kitsune to generate code that traverses and transforms
old-version state for use by new code. We find that Kitsune requires
few program changes and provides fast update times and essentially no
overhead.<p>[ <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mwh/papers/kitsune-journal.pdf">.pdf</a> ]
