Static analysis tools have achieved great success in recent years in automating the process of
detecting defects in software. However, these sophisticated tools have yet to gain widespread
adoption, since many of these tools remain too difficult to understand and use. In
previous work, we discovered that even with an effective code visualization tool, users still found
it hard to determine if warnings reported by these tools were true errors or false warnings.
The fundamental problem users face is to understand enough of the underlying algorithm to determine
if a warning is caused by imprecision in the algorithm. In our current work, we propose to use
<em>triaging checklists</em> to provide users with systematic guidance to identify false warnings by
taking into account specific sources of imprecision in the particular tool. Additionally, we plan to
provide <em>checklist assistants</em>, which is a library of simple analyses designed to aid users in
answering checklist questions.
