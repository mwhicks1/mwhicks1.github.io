  Dynamic software updating (DSU) systems allow programs to be updated
  while running, thereby allowing developers to add features and fix
  bugs without downtime.  This paper introduces Kitsune, a new DSU
  system for C whose design has three notable features.  First,
  Kitsune's updating mechanism updates the whole program, not
  individual functions.  This mechanism is more flexible than most
  prior approaches and places no restrictions on data representations
  or allowed compiler optimizations.  Second, Kitsune makes the
  important aspects of updating explicit in the program text, making
  its semantics easy to understand while keeping programmer work to a
  minimum.  Finally, the programmer can write simple specifications to
  direct Kitsune to generate code that traverses and transforms
  old-version state for use by the new code; such state
  transformation is often necessary, and is significantly more
  difficult in prior DSU systems.  We have used Kitsune
  to update five popular, open-source, single- and multi-threaded
  programs, and find that few program changes are required to use
  Kitsune, and that it incurs essentially no performance overhead.
