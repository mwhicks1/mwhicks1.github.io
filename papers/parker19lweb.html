  This paper presents LWeb, a framework for enforcing label-based,
  information flow policies in database-using web applications. In a
  nutshell, LWeb marries the LIO Haskell IFC enforcement library
  with the Yesod web programming framework. The implementation has
  two parts. First, we extract the core of LIO into a monad
  transformer (LMonad) and then apply it to Yesod's core monad. Second,
  we extend Yesod's table definition DSL and query functionality to
  permit defining and enforcing label-based policies on tables and enforcing
  them during query processing. LWeb's policy language is expressive,
  permitting dynamic per-table and per-row policies. We formalize the
  essence of LWeb in the LWebcalc calculus and mechanize the proof of
  noninterference in Liquid Haskell. This mechanization constitutes
  the first metatheoretic proof carried out in Liquid Haskell. We also
  used LWeb to build a substantial web site hosting the <em>Build it,
  Break it, Fix it</em> security-oriented programming contest. The site
  involves 40 data tables and sophisticated policies. Compared to
  manually checking security policies, LWeb imposes a modest runtime
  overhead of between 2% to 21%. It reduces
  the trusted code base from the whole application to just 1% of the
  application code, and 21% of the code overall (when counting LWeb too).
