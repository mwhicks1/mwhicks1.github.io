Flash memory is a semiconductor memory technology that has interesting
price, performance, and semantic tradeoffs. We have developed Gordon,
a general-purpose persistence system for Standard ML that uses Flash
mapped into the virtual address space as its stable storage medium.<p>
Flash supports a write-once/bulk-erase interface that makes it
difficult to support update-in-place semantics. In addition, Flash
chips are only guaranteed to survive a limited number of erase
cycles. Gordon has been designed to overcome these difficulties, and
our performance analysis demonstrates good performance and reasonable
lifetimes for appropriate application domains.<p>[&nbsp;<a href="https://mwhicks1.github.io/papers/flash.ps">.ps</a>&nbsp;]
