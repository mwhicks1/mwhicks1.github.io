  An oblivious computation is one that is free of direct and indirect
  information leaks, e.g., due to observable differences in timing and
  memory access patterns.  This paper presents
  <EM>L</EM><sub>obliv</sub>, a core language whose type system enforces obliviousness.
  Prior work on type-enforced oblivious computation has focused on
  deterministic programs. <EM>L</EM><sub>obliv</sub> is new in its consideration of
  programs that implement <em>probabilistic</em> algorithms, such as
  those involved in cryptography. <EM>L</EM><sub>obliv</sub> employs a substructural type
  system and a novel notion of <em>probability region</em> to ensure that
  information is not leaked via the distribution of visible
  events. The use of regions was motivated by a source of unsoundness
  that we discovered in the type system of ObliVM, a language for implementing
  state of the art oblivious algorithms and data structures. We prove
  that <EM>L</EM><sub>obliv</sub>'s type system enforces obliviousness and show that it is nevertheless
  powerful enough to check state-of-the-art, efficient oblivious
  data structures, such as stacks and queues, and even tree-based
  oblivious RAMs.
