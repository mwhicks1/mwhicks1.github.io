  Label flow analysis is a fundamental static analysis problem with a
  wide variety of applications.  Previous work by Mossin developed a
  polynomial time subtyping-based label flow inference that supports
  Hindley-Milner style polymorphism with polymorphic recursion.  Rehof
  et al have developed an efficient <em>O</em>(<em>n</em><sup>3</sup>) inference algorithm for
  Mossin's system based on context-free language (CFL) reachability.
  In this paper, we extend these results to a system that also
  supports existential polymorphism, which is important for precisely
  describing correlations among members of a structured type, even
  when values of that type are part of dynamic data structures.  We
  first develop a provably sound checking system based on
  polymorphically-constrained types.  As usual, we restrict universal
  quantification to the top level of a type, but existential
  quantification is first class, with subtyping allowed between
  existentials with the same binding structure.  We then develop a
  CFL-based inference system.  Programmers specify which positions in
  a type are existentially quantified, and the algorithm infers the
  constraints bound in the type, or rejects a program if the
  annotations are inconsistent.
