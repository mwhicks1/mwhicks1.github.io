  The goal of the Cyclone project is to investigate 
  type safety for low-level languages such as C .  Our
  hardest challenge has been providing programmers control over memory
  management while retaining type safety.  This paper reports on our
  experience trying to integrate and effectively use two previously
  proposed, type-safe memory management mechanisms: statically-scoped regions 
  and unique pointers.  We found that these typing mechanisms can be combined 
  to build alternative memory-management abstractions, such as reference 
  counted objects and arenas with dynamic lifetimes, and thus provide
  a flexible basis.  Our experience---porting C code and building new
  applications for resource-constrained systems---confirms that experts can use 
  these features to improve memory footprint and
  sometimes to improve
  throughput when used instead of, or in combination with, a conservative 
  garbage collector.
