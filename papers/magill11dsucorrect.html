  Recently, there has been much interest in dynamic software updating
  (DSU) systems, which allow running programs to be patched on-the-fly
  to add features or fix bugs.  While dynamic updates can be tricky
  to write, techniques for establishing their
  correctness have received little attention.
  In this paper, we present the first methodology for automatically
  verifying the correctness of dynamic updates.  Programmers express
  the desired properties of an updated execution using
  <em>client-oriented specifications</em> (CO-specs), which can describe a
  wide range of behaviors visible from clients' points of view.
  Then we verify CO-specs automatically by combining the old and new
  versions of a program, along with the CO-spec, into a single
  <em>merged program</em> which we can analyze with off-the-shelf tools.
  We formalize the merging transformation and prove it correct.  With
  our implementation of a C-program merger, we merged actual updates
  to the Redis key-value server, as well as updates to some synthetic
  programs.  We found that Thor, a verification tool, was capable of
  checking many of the synthetic examples, while Otter, a symbolic
  executor, could check every example, often in less than a minute.
  Both tools were able to detect faulty patches and incurred only a
  4&#215; slowdown, on average, compared with checking individual
  versions.
