A <em>proxy</em> object is a surrogate or placeholder that controls access to
another target object.  Proxies can be used to support distributed
programming, lazy or parallel evaluation, access control, and other simple
forms of behavioral reflection.  However, <em>wrapper proxies</em>
(like <em>futures</em> or <em>suspensions</em> for yet-to-be-computed results)
can require significant code changes to be used in statically-typed
languages, while proxies more generally can inadvertently violate
assumptions of transparency, resulting in subtle bugs.<p>
To solve these problems, we have designed and implemented a simple framework
for proxy programming that employs a static analysis based on qualifier
inference, but with additional novelties.  Code for
using wrapper proxies is automatically introduced via a
classfile-to-classfile transformation, and potential violations of
transparency are signaled to the programmer.  We have formalized our
analysis and proven it sound.  Our framework has a variety of applications,
including support for asynchronous method calls returning futures.
Experimental results demonstrate the benefits of our framework: programmers
are relieved of managing and/or checking proxy usage, analysis times are
reasonably fast, overheads introduced by added dynamic checks are
negligible, and performance improvements can be significant.  For example,
changing two lines in a simple RMI-based peer-to-peer application and then
using our framework resulted in a large performance gain.
