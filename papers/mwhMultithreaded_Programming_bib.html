One common technique for preventing data races in multi-threaded
programs is to ensure that all accesses to shared locations are
consistently protected by a lock.  We present a tool called Locksmith
for detecting data races in C programs by looking for violations of
this pattern.  We call the relationship between locks and the
locations they protect consistent correlation, and the core of our
technique is a novel constraint-based analysis that infers
consistent correlation context-sensitively, using the results to check that
locations are properly guarded by locks.  We present the core of
our algorithm for a simple formal language \emph{lambda-corr} which we have
proven sound, and discuss how we scale it up to an algorithm that
aims to be sound for all of C.
We develop several techniques to improve the precision and
performance of the analysis, including a sharing analysis for
inferring thread locality; existential quantification for modeling
locks in data structures; and heuristics for modeling unsafe
features of C such as type casts.  When applied to several
benchmarks, including multi-threaded servers and Linux device
drivers, Locksmith found several races while producing a modest
number of false alarms.

  title = {Transparent Proxies for {Java} Futures (Extended version)},
  month = {October},
  year = 2004,
  where = {Vancouver, Canada},
  abstract = {
A \emph{proxy} object is a surrogate or placeholder that controls access to
another target object.  Proxies can be used to support distributed
programming, lazy or parallel evaluation, access control, and other simple
forms of behavioral reflection.  However, \emph{wrapper proxies}
(like \emph{futures} or \emph{suspensions} for yet-to-be-computed results)
can require significant code changes to be used in statically-typed
languages, while proxies more generally can inadvertently violate
assumptions of transparency, resulting in subtle bugs.

To solve these problems, we have designed and implemented a simple framework
for proxy programming that employs a static analysis based on qualifier
inference, but with additional novelties.  Code for
using wrapper proxies is automatically introduced via a
classfile-to-classfile transformation, and potential violations of
transparency are signaled to the programmer.  We have formalized our
analysis and proven it sound.  Our framework has a variety of applications,
including support for asynchronous method calls returning futures.
Experimental results demonstrate the benefits of our framework: programmers
are relieved of managing and/or checking proxy usage, analysis times are
reasonably fast, overheads introduced by added dynamic checks are
negligible, and performance improvements can be significant.  For example,
changing two lines in a simple RMI-based peer-to-peer application and then
using our framework resulted in a large performance gain.
