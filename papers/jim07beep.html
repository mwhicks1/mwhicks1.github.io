  Web sites that accept and display content such as wiki articles or
  comments typically filter the content to prevent injected script
  code from running in browsers that view the site.  The diversity of
  browser rendering algorithms and the desire to allow rich content
  make filtering quite difficult, however, and attacks such as the
  Samy and Yamanner worms have exploited filtering weaknesses.  This
  paper proposes a simple alternative mechanism for preventing script
  injection called Browser-Enforced Embedded Policies (BEEP).  The idea is that a
  web site can embed a policy in its pages that specifies which
  scripts are allowed to run.  The browser, which knows exactly when
  it will run a script, can enforce this policy perfectly.  We have
  added BEEP support to several browsers, and built tools to
  simplify adding policies to web applications.  We found that
  supporting BEEP in browsers requires only small and localized
  modifications, modifying web applications requires minimal effort,
  and enforcing policies is generally lightweight.
