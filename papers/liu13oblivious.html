  Cloud computing allows users to delegate data and computation to
  cloud service providers, at the cost of giving up physical control
  of their computing infrastructure.  An attacker (e.g., insider) with
  physical access to the computing platform can perform various
  physical attacks, including probing memory buses and cold-boot style
  attacks.  Previous work on secure (co-)processors provides hardware
  support for memory encryption and prevents direct leakage of
  sensitive data over the memory bus.  However, an adversary snooping
  on the bus can still infer sensitive information from the memory
  access traces.  Existing work on Oblivious RAM (ORAM) provides a
  solution for users to put all data in an ORAM; and accesses to an
  ORAM are obfuscated such that no information leaks through memory
  access traces.  This method, however, incurs significant memory
  access overhead.<p>
  In this work, we are among the first to leverage programming
  language techniques to offer efficient memory-trace oblivious
  program execution, while providing formal security guarantees.  We
  formally define the notion of memory-trace obliviousness, and
  provide a type system for verifying that a program satisfies this
  property.  We also describe a compiler that transforms a program
  into a structurally similar one that satisfies memory trace
  obliviousness.  To achieve optimal efficiency, our compiler
  partitions variables into several small ORAM banks rather than one
  large one, without risking security.  We use several example
  programs to demonstrate the efficiency gains our compiler achieves
  in comparison with the naive method of placing all variables in the
  same ORAM.
