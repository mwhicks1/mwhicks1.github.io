  Dynamic software updating (DSU) systems eliminate costly downtime by
  dynamically fixing bugs and adding features to executing programs.
  Given a static <em>code</em> patch, most DSU systems construct runtime
  code changes automatically.  However, a dynamic update must also
  specify how to change the running program's execution <em>state</em>,
  e.g., the stack and heap, to make it compatible with the new code.
  Constructing such <em>state transformations</em> correctly and
  automatically remains an open problem.  This paper presents a
  solution called <em>Targeted Object Synthesis</em> (TOS).  TOS first executes the same tests on
  the old and new program versions separately, observing the program
  heap state at a few corresponding points.  Given two corresponding
  heap states, TOS
  <em>matches</em> objects in the two versions using <em>key</em> fields
  that uniquely identify objects and correlate old and new-version
  objects. Given example object pairs, TOS then <em>synthesizes</em> the simplest-possible 
  function that transforms an old-version object to its new-version
  counterpart. We show
  that TOS  is effective on updates to four open-source server
  programs for which it generates non-trivial transformation functions that use conditionals,
  operate on collections, and fix memory leaks. These transformations help programmers
  understand their changes and apply dynamic software updates.
