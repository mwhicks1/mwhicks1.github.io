The increased complexity of the service model relative to store-and-forward
routers, has made resource management one of the paramount concerns in
active networking research and engineering. Previous work investigated
methods for controlling access to resources by restricting namespaces
or providing limited functionality in a domain-specific language.
Combinations of these methods and scheduling technologies have also been used
to demonstrate a resource-managed node architecture. In this paper, we address
Two major challenges in scaling resource management to many-node active
networks.  The first is the use of market mechanisms and trading amongst nodes
and programs with varying degrees of competition and cooperation to provide a
scalable approach to managing active network resources. The second is the use
of a trust-management architecture to ensure that the participants in the
resource management marketplace have a policy-driven &ldquo;rule of law&rdquo;
in which marketplace decisions can be made and relied upon. We have used
lottery scheduling and the Keynote trust-management system for our
implementation, for which we provide some initial performance indications.
