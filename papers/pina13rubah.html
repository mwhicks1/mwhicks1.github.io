  Upgrades (HotSWUp)</em>, June 2013.</font><p>
  This paper presents Rubah, a new dynamic software updating (DSU)
  system for Java programs that works on stock VMs.  Rubah supports a
  large range of program changes (e.g., changes to the class hierarchy
  and updates to running methods), does not restrict important
  programming idioms (e.g., reflection), and, as shown by performance
  experiments using an updatable version of the H2 database management
  system, imposes low overhead on normal execution.
