  Recent years have seen significant advances in dynamic software
  updating (DSU) systems, which allow programs to be patched
  on the fly.  However, a significant challenge remains: How can we
  ensure the act of applying a patch does not itself introduce errors?
  In this paper, we address this problem by presenting a new systematic
  testing methodology for updatable programs.
  Our idea is to transform standard 
  system tests into <em>update tests</em> that execute as before, but
  each transformed test applies a patch at a different <em>update point</em> 
  during execution.  To mitigate the increase in the number of tests, we
  developed an algorithm for <em>test suite 
    minimization</em> that finds a subset of update points that, if fully
  tested, yields the equivalent to full update point coverage.  We
  implemented our approach and evaluated it on OpenSSH and vsftpd, two
  widely used server applications.  We found that minimization is
  highly effective; that when updates are allowed almost anywhere,
  many update tests fail; and that excluding type unsafe update points
  eliminates nearly, but not quite all, failing update tests.
