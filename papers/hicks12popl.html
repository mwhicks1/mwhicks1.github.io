It was a pleasure and a privilege to serve as the program committee
(PC) chair of the 39th Symposium on the Principles of Programming
Languages (POPL).  This paper describes the review process we used,
why we used it, and an assessment of how it worked out.<p>
We made some substantial changes to the review process this year, most
notably by incorporating a form of double-blind reviewing.  These and
other changes were made in an attempt to improve accepted paper
quality, as well as to improve review quality and fairness (both of which
ultimately support paper quality).<p>
Much of this paper argues in favor of these changes based on
principle, i.e., why one might think the process should increase
quality.  Ideally we could also evaluate the process directly, i.e.,
by showing that this year's program was better than it would have been
under a different review process.  Unfortunately, I think it would be
very difficult to efficiently evaluate a review process directly
(e.g., by having two committees and two review processes on the same
papers).  As such, I exercised a more tractable alternative: I polled
the authors and reviewers to report on their experience, and to see
whether that experience convinces them that the process has merit.  In
most cases, the answer was &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;
