<em>Chunks</em> are a programming construct in PLAN, the Packet Language for
Active Networks, comprised of a code segment and a suspended function call.
In PLAN, chunks provide support for encapsulation and other packet
programming techniques.  This paper begins by explaining the semantics and
implementation of chunks.  We proceed, using several PLAN source code
examples, to demonstrate the usefulness of chunks for micro-protocols,
asynchronous adaptation, and as units of authentication granularity.
