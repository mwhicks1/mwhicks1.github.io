  Ruby is a popular, dynamic scripting language that aims to &ldquo;feel
  natural to programmers&rdquo; and give users the &ldquo;freedom to choose&rdquo;
  among many different ways of doing the same thing.  While this
  arguably makes programming in Ruby easier, it makes it hard to build
  analysis and transformation tools that operate on Ruby source code.
  In this paper, we present the Ruby Intermediate Language (RIL), a
  Ruby front-end and intermediate representation that addresses these
  challenges.  Our system includes an extensible GLR parser for Ruby,
  and an automatic translation into RIL, an easy-to-analyze
  intermediate form.  This translation eliminates redundant language
  constructs, unravels the often subtle ordering among side effecting
  operations, and makes implicit interpreter operations explicit in
  its representation.<p>
  We demonstrate the usefulness of RIL by presenting a simple static
  analysis and source code transformation to eliminate null pointer
  errors in Ruby programs.  We also describe several additional useful
  features of RIL, including a pretty printer that outputs RIL as
  syntactically valid Ruby code, a dataflow analysis engine, and a
  dynamic instrumentation library for profiling source code.  We hope
  that RIL's features will enable others to more easily build analysis
  tools for Ruby, and that our design will inspire the creation of
  similar frameworks for other dynamic languages.
