Dynamic software updating (DSU), the practice of updating software while it
executes, is a lively area of research.  The DSU approach most
prominent in both commercial and research systems is <em>in-place
  updating</em>, in which patches containing program modifications are
loaded into a running
process.  However, in-place updating suffers from several problems: it
requires complex tool support, it may adversely affect the performance of
normal execution, it requires challenging reasoning to understand the
behavior of an updated program, and it requires extra effort to modify
program state to be compatible with an update.<p>
This paper presents preliminary work investigating the potential for <em>state
transfer updating</em> to address these problems.  State transfer updates
work by launching a new process running the updated program version
and transferring program state from the running process to the updated
version.  In this paper, we describe the use and implementation of
Ekiden, a new state transfer updating library for C/C++ programs.
Ekiden seeks to redress the difficulties of in-place updating, and we report
on our experience updating vsftpd using Ekiden.  This initial
experience suggests that state transfer provides the availability
benefits of in-place DSU approaches while addressing many of their
shortcomings.
