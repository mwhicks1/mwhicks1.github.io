<font size="+1"><b>Expositor: Scriptable Time-Travel Debugging with First Class Traces</b>.
  Yit&nbsp;Phang Khoo, Jeffrey&nbsp;S. Foster, and Michael Hicks, August 2012.</font><p>
  We present Expositor, a new debugging environment that combines
  scripting and time-travel debugging to allow developers to automate
  complex debugging tasks. The fundamental abstraction provided by
  Expositor is the execution <em>trace</em>, which is a time-indexed
  sequence of program state snapshots. Developers can manipulate traces as if they were simple
  lists with operations such as map and filter. Under the hood,
  Expositor efficiently implements traces as lazy, sparse
  interval trees, whose contents are materialized on demand.
  Expositor also provides a novel data
  structure, the <em>edit hash array mapped trie</em>, which is a lazy
  implementation of sets, maps, multisets, and multimaps that enables
  developers to maximize the efficiency of their debugging scripts.  We have used
  Expositor to debug a stack overflow and to unravel a subtle
  data race in Firefox. We believe that
  Expositor represents an important step forward in improving the
  technology for diagnosing complex, hard-to-understand bugs.
