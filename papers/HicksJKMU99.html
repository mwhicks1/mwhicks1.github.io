We describe a native-code implementation of Java that supports distributed
objects. In order to foster the correctness of distributed programs, remote
access is syntactically and semantically indistinguishable from local
access. This transparency is provided by the runtime system through the
implicit generation of remote references to an object when it is passed as
an argument or returned from a remote method call. Consistency is achieved
through the use of a distributed (and thus scalable) global addressing
scheme.  Experiments show that application performance is a function of data
layout, access algorithm, and local workload. For distributed applications,
such as distributed databases, these factors may not be known statically,
suggesting the importance of runtime support.
