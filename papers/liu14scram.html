RAM-model secure computation addresses the inherent limitations
of circuit-model secure computation considered in almost all previous work.
Here, we describe the first <em>automated</em> approach for
RAM-model secure computation in the semi-honest model.
We define an intermediate representation
called SCVM and a corresponding type system suited for RAM-model secure computation.
Leveraging compile-time optimizations, our approach achieves
order-of-magnitude speedups compared to both circuit-model secure
computation and the state-of-art RAM-model secure computation.
