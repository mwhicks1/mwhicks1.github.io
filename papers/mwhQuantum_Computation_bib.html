As quantum computing steadily progresses from theory to practice, programmers are faced with a common problem: How can they be sure that their code does what they intend it to do? This paper presents encouraging results in the application of mechanized proof to the domain of quantum programming in the context of the SQIR development. It verifies the correctness of a range of a quantum algorithms including Simon's algorithm, Grover's algorithm and quantum phase estimation, a key component of Shor's algorithm. In doing so, it aims to highlight both the successes and challenges of formal verification in the quantum context and motivate the theorem proving community to target quantum computing as an application domain.

  abstract = {
We present VOQC, the first fully \emph{verified optimizer for quantum circuits}, written using the Coq proof assistant. Quantum circuits are expressed as programs in a simple, low-level language called SQIR, a \emph{simple quantum intermediate representation}, which is deeply embedded in Coq. Optimizations and other transformations are expressed as Coq functions, which are proved correct with respect to a semantics of SQIR programs. 
SQIR uses a semantics of matrices of complex numbers, which is the standard for quantum computation, but treats matrices symbolically in order to reason about programs that use an arbitrary number of quantum bits. 
SQIR's careful design and our provided automation make it possible to write and verify a broad range of optimizations in VOQC,
including full-circuit transformations from cutting-edge optimizers.},

  title = {Verified Optimization in a Quantum Intermediate Representation},
  abstract = {
We present sqire, a low-level language for quantum computing and verification. sqire uses a global register of quantum bits, allowing easy compilation to and from existing `quantum assembly' languages and simplifying the verification process. We demonstrate the power of sqire as an intermediate representation of quantum programs by verifying a number of useful optimizations, and we demonstrate sqire's use as a tool for general verification by proving several quantum programs correct.

  abstract = {
Quantum programming is hard: Quantum programs are necessarily probabilistic and impossible to examine without disrupting the execution of a program. In response to this challenge, we and a number of other researchers have written tools to verify quantum programs against their intended semantics. \emph{This is not enough.} Verifying an idealized semantics against a real world quantum program doesn't allow you to confidently predict the program's output. In order to have verification that works, you need both an error semantics related to the hardware at hand (this is necessarily low level) and certified compilation to the that same hardware. Once we have these two things, we can talk about an approach to quantum programming where we start by writing and verifying programs at a high level, attempt to verify properties of the compiled code, and repeat as necessary.

  abstract = {
  Quantum computation is a topic of significant recent interest, with
practical advances coming from both research and
industry. A major challenge in 
quantum programming is dealing with errors (quantum noise) during
execution. Because quantum resources (e.g., qubits) are scarce,
classical error correction techniques applied at the level of the
architecture are currently cost-prohibitive. But while this reality means
that quantum programs are almost certain to have errors, there as yet
exists no principled means to reason about erroneous behavior.
This paper attempts to fill this gap by developing a semantics for
erroneous quantum while-programs, as well as a logic for reasoning
about them. This logic permits proving a property we have
identified, called $\epsilon$-robustness, which characterizes
possible ``distance'' between an ideal program and an erroneous one. We
have proved the logic sound, and showed its utility on several case
studies, notably: (1) analyzing the robustness of noisy versions of the
quantum Bernoulli factory (QBF) and quantum walk (QW); (2) demonstrating
the (in)effectiveness of different error correction schemes on
single-qubit errors; and (3) analyzing the robustness of a
fault-tolerant version of QBF.
