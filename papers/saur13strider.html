  A range of C application services work by traversing
  the heap, including checkpointing systems, heap profilers, heap
  assertion checkers, and program state transformers for dynamic
  software updating. Existing implementations all reimplement heap
  traversal in an ad hoc manner.  In this paper, we present , a
  general framework for writing heap traversals such as those just
  mentioned.  takes the
  source files of a program as input and, based on the type
  information found, generates versatile, type-aware heap
  traversal code. This generated traversal can be specialized in two
  ways. First, service-writers (e.g., a developer implementing a
  serialization service) can write <em>action code</em> invoked by the
  traversal API to implement their service. Second,
  programmers can customize both the traversal and the actions of a
  service for their particular program, e.g., a programmer could
  customize a heap checker to check program-specific properties. We
  have implemented  and evaluated its utility by building several
  services-including serialization, heap checking, and dynamic
  software updating-and applied them to several real
  applications. We find that these services are both efficient and
  effective.
