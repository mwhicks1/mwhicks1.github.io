  This paper presents CMod, a novel tool that provides a sound
  module system for C .  CMod works by enforcing a set of four rules
  that are based on principles of modular reasoning and on current
  programming practice.  CMod's rules flesh out the convention that
  <tt>.h</tt> header files are module interfaces and <tt>.c</tt>
  source files are module implementations.  Although this convention
  is well-known, developing CMod's rules revealed there are many
  subtleties in applying the basic pattern correctly.  We have proven
  formally that CMod's rules enforce both information hiding and
  type-safe linking.
  We evaluated CMod on a number of benchmarks, and found
  that most programs obey CMod's rules, or can be made to with
  minimal effort, while rule violations reveal brittle coding practices
  including numerous information hiding violations and occasional type errors.
