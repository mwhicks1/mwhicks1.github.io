Like any non-trivial software system, SDNs periodically need to be updated to
fix bugs, add features, and improve performance. A strawman approach would be
to stop the controller, wipe the rules on the switches, and restart the
controller, which then repopulates the switches with appropriate rules. But
this approach loses any state maintained by the controller (and encoded in the
switch rules), and worse, may cause the SDN to behave incorrectly; e.g., for
stateful firewalls (whose policies are based in part on observed behavior), a
previously blocked hostâ€™s packets may be let through.<P>
This paper presents Boombox, a new SDN controller designed with network updates
in mind. Unlike prior approaches based on recording controller events, and
replaying them post-update to restore the controller state, Boombox allows the
programmer to update the state directly, as kept in a persistent network
information base (NIB). This approach, inspired by work on dynamic software
updates, is both flexible and efficient. We demonstrate Boombox's effectiveness
with experiments that show that existing flows' operation is only marginally
disrupted during updates to several services, include a stateful firewall, a
topology discovery engine, and a router.
