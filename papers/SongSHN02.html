A key early objective of Active Networking (AN) was to support
on-the-fly network evolution.  Although AN has been used
relatively extensively to build application-customized protocols
and even whole networking systems, demonstrations of evolution
have been limited.  This paper examines three AN mechanisms and how they enable
evolution: active packets and plug-in extensions, well-known to the AN
community, and update extensions, which are novel to AN.  We devote our
presentation to a series of demonstrations of how each type of evolution can
be applied to the problem of adding support for mobility to a network. This
represents the most large-scale demonstration of AN evolution to date. These
demonstrations show what previous AN research has not: that AN technology
can, in fact, support very significant changes to the network, even while
the network is operational.
