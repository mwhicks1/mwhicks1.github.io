Many important applications must run continuously and without interruption,
yet must be changed to fix bugs or upgrade functionality.  No
prior general-purpose methodology for dynamic updating achieves a practical
balance between flexibility, robustness, low overhead, and ease of use.<p>
We present a new approach for C-like languages that provides type-safe
dynamic updating of native code in an extremely flexible manner (code, data,
and types may be updated, at programmer-determined times) and permits the
use of automated tools to aid the programmer in the updating process.  Our
system is based on <em>dynamic patches</em> that both contain the updated code
and the code needed to transition from the old version to the new.  A novel
aspect of our patches is that they consist of <em>verifiable native code</em>
(<em>e.g.</em> Proof-Carrying Code or Typed Assembly
Language, which is native code accompanied by
annotations that allow on-line verification of the code's safety.  We
discuss how patches are generated mostly automatically, how they are applied
using dynamic-linking technology, and how code is compiled to make it
updateable.<p>
To concretely illustrate our system, we have implemented a
dynamically-updateable web server, FlashEd.  We discuss our experience
building and maintaining FlashEd.  Performance experiments show that for
FlashEd, the overhead due to updating is typically less than 1 percent.
