  Bayesian probability models uncertain knowledge and learning from observations. As a defining feature of optimal adversarial behaviour, Bayesian reasoning forms the basis of safety properties in contexts such as privacy and fairness. Probabilistic programming is a convenient implementation of Bayesian reasoning but the adversarial setting imposes obstacles to its use: approximate inference can underestimate adversary knowledge and exact inference is impractical in cases covering large state spaces.<p>
By abstracting distributions, the semantics of a probabilistic language, and inference, jointly termed <em>probabilistic abstract interpretation</em>, we demonstrate adversary models both approximate and sound.<p>
We apply the techniques to build a privacy protecting monitor and describe how to trade off the precision and computational cost in its implementation all the while remaining sound with respect to privacy risk bounds.<p>[&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/foundations-of-probabilistic-programming/819623B1B5B33836476618AC0621F0EE">http</a>&nbsp;]
