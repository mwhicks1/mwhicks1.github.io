  Dynamic software updating (DSU) systems 
  facilitate software updates to running programs,
  thereby permitting developers to add features and fix
  bugs without downtime.  This paper introduces Kitsune, a DSU
  system for C. Kitsune's design has three notable features.  First,
  Kitsune updates the whole program, rather than
  individual functions, using a mechanism that places no restrictions on data
  representations or allowed compiler optimizations.
  Second, Kitsune makes the
  important aspects of updating explicit in the program text, making
  the program's semantics easy to understand while minimizing programmer effort.
  Finally, the programmer can write simple specifications to
  direct Kitsune to generate code that traverses and transforms
  old-version state for use by new code; such state
  transformation is often necessary and is significantly more
  difficult in prior DSU systems.  We have used Kitsune
  to update six popular, open-source, single- and multi-threaded
  programs, and find that few program changes are required to use
  Kitsune, that it incurs essentially no performance overhead,
  and that update times are fast.<p>[&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mwh/papers/kitsune-journal.pdf">.pdf</a>&nbsp;]
