Current active measurement techniques run independently of application
traffic and compete with it for bandwidth.  As a remedy to this, some
applications try to use their own traffic to perform measurement, but
this is done in an ad hoc manner that is tightly coupled to the
application itself. On the other hand, most standalone active
measurement tools include significant portions of empty padding in their
probes.  A natural optimization is to reuse this wasted bandwidth for
useful data, enabling applications to measure the network in the course
of sending their own data traffic.<P>
In this paper we present MGRP, a system for transparently integrating
measurement and application traffic. Through a series of experiments and
empirical evaluation we show that MGRP permits continuous network
measurement in the presence of application traffic.  This enables
applications to quickly respond to varying network conditions with
minimal impact on their own traffic and competing traffic while
increasing the timeliness of measurement results.
