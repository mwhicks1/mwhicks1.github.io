Cyclone is a type-safe programming language intended for applications
requiring control over memory management.  Our previous work on
Cyclone included support for stack allocation, lexical region
allocation, and a garbage-collected heap.  We achieved safety (i.e.,
prevented dangling pointers) through a region-based type-and-effects
system.  This paper describes some new memory-management mechanisms
that we have integrated into Cyclone: dynamic regions, unique
pointers, and reference-counted objects.  Our experience shows that
these new mechanisms are well suited for the timely recovery of
objects in situations where it is awkward to use lexical regions.
Crucially, programmers can write reusable functions without
unnecessarily restricting callers' choices among the variety of
memory-management options. To achieve this goal, Cyclone employs a
combination of polymorphism and scoped constructs that temporarily let
us treat objects as if they were allocated in a lexical region.  In
our experience, our new constructs can significantly improve
application performance, while adding a modest programming overhead.
