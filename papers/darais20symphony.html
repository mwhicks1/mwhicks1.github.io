Secure multi-party computation (MPC) allows mutually distrusting
parties to cooperatively compute, using a cryptographic protocol, a
function over their private data. 
This paper presents Symphony, an expressive yet concise domain-specific
language for expressing MPCs. Symphony starts with the standard,
simply-typed &lambda; calculus extended with integers, sums,
products, recursive types, and references. It layers on two additional
elements: (1) A datatype representing <em>secret shares</em>, which are
the basis of multiparty computation, and (2) a simple mechanism called
<em>par blocks</em> to express which scopes are to be executed by which
parties, and which determine to whom various data values are visible
at any given time. The meaning of a Symphony program can be expressed
using a <em>single-threaded semantics</em> even though in actuality the
program will be run by multiple communicating parties in parallel. Our
<em>distributed semantics</em> is expressed naturally as piecewise,
single-threaded steps of <em>slices</em> of the program among its
parties. We prove that these two semantic interpretations of a program
coincide, and we prove a standard type soundness result.
To demonstrate Symphony's expressiveness, we have built an interpreter
for it (with some extensions) and used it to implement a number of
realistic MPC applications, including sorting, statistical and numeric
computations, and private information retrieval.
