  Secure multi-party computation (MPC) enables a set of mutually
distrusting parties to cooperatively compute, using a cryptographic
protocol, a function over their private data. 
This paper presents Wys<sup>*</sup>, a new domain-specific language (DSL)
for writing MPCs. Wys<sup>*</sup> is an embedded DSL hosted in F<sup>*</sup>, a
verification-oriented, effectful programming language.
Wys<sup>*</sup> source programs are
essentially F<sup>*</sup> programs written in a custom MPC effect, meaning
that the programmers can use F<sup>*</sup>'s logic to verify the correctness
and security properties of their programs. To reason about the
distributed runtime semantics of these programs, we formalize a deep
embedding of Wys<sup>*</sup>, also in F<sup>*</sup>. We mechanize the necessary
metatheory to prove that the properties verified for the Wys<sup>*</sup>
source programs carry over to the distributed, multi-party
semantics. Finally, we use F<sup>*</sup>'s extraction mechanism to
extract an interpreter that we have proved matches this semantics,
yielding a verified implementation. Wys<sup>*</sup> is the first
DSL to enable formal verification of source MPC programs, and also the
first MPC DSL to provide a verified implementation.
With Wys<sup>*</sup> we have implemented several MPC protocols, including
private set intersection, joint median, and an MPC-based card dealing
application, and have verified their security and correctness.
