  A <em>contextual effects</em> system generalizes standard type
  and effect systems: where a standard effects system computes the
  effect of an expression <em>e</em>, a contextual effects system
  additionally computes the <em>prior</em> and <em>future</em> effect of
  <em>e</em>, which characterize the behavior of computation prior to, and
  following, respectively, the evaluation of <em>e</em>.  This paper
  describes the formalization and proof of soundness of contextual
  effects, which we mechanized using the Coq proof assistant.
  Contextual effect soundness is an unusual property because the prior
  and future effect of a term <em>e</em> depends not on <em>e</em> itself (or its
  evaluation), but rather on the evaluation of the context in which
  <em>e</em> appears.  Therefore, to state and prove soundness we must
  &ldquo;match up&rdquo; a subterm in the original typing derivation with the
  possibly-many evaluations of that subterm during the evaluation of
  the program, in a way that is robust under substitution.  We do this
  using a novel typed operational semantics.  We conjecture that our
  approach could prove useful for approaching other properties of
  derivations that rely on the context in which that derivation
  appears.
