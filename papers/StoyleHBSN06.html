This paper presents Proteus, a core calculus that models dynamic
software updating, a service for fixing bugs and adding features to a
running program.  Proteus permits a program's type structure to change
dynamically but guarantees the updated program remains type-correct by
ensuring a property we call &ldquo;con-freeness.&rdquo;  We show how con-freeness
can be enforced dynamically, and how it can be approximated via a
novel static analysis.  This analysis can be used to assess the
implications of a program's structure on future updates, to make
update success more predictable.  We have implemented Proteus for C,
and briefly discuss our implementation, which we have tested on
several well-known programs.
