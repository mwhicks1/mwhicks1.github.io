In this paper, we study the problem of automatically finding program
executions that reach a particular target line. This problem arises
in many debugging scenarios; for example, a developer may want to confirm
that a bug reported by a static analysis tool on a particular line is
a true positive. 
We propose two new <em>directed</em> 
symbolic execution strategies that aim to solve this problem:
<em>shortest-distance symbolic execution (SDSE)</em> uses a distance metric in
an interprocedural control flow graph to guide symbolic execution toward a
particular target; and <em>call-chain-backward symbolic execution (CCBSE)</em>
iteratively runs forward symbolic execution, starting in the function
containing the target line, and then jumping backward up the call chain
until it finds a feasible path from the start of the program. 
We also propose a hybrid strategy, Mix-CCBSE, which alternates CCBSE with
another (forward) search strategy.  We compare these three with several
existing strategies from the literature on a suite of six GNU
coreutils programs. 
We find that SDSE performs extremely well in many cases
but may fail badly. CCBSE also performs quite well, but imposes
additional overhead that sometimes makes it slower than SDSE.  Considering
all our benchmarks together, Mix-CCBSE performed best on average,
combining to good effect the features of its constituent components.
