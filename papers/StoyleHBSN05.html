Dynamic software updates can be used to fix bugs or add features to a
running program without downtime.  Essential for some applications and
convenient for others, low-level dynamic updating support has been
used for many years.  However, there is little high-level
understanding that would support programmers in writing dynamic
updates effectively.<p>
In an effort to bridge this gap, we present a formal calculus called
Proteus for modeling dynamic software updating in C-like languages
that is flexible, safe, and predictable.  Proteus supports dynamic
updates to functions (even those that are active) and types, allowing
on-line evolution to match source-code evolution as we have observed
it in practice.  All updates are provably type-safe and
<em>representation-consistent</em>, meaning that only one version of a given
type may exist in the program at any time, simplifying reasoning and
avoiding unintuitive copy-based semantics.  Finally, Proteus's novel
and efficient static <em>updateability analysis</em> allows a programmer to
automatically prove that an update is independent of the on-line
program state, and thus predict it will not fail dynamically.  Proteus
admits a straightforward implementation, and we sketch how it could be
extended to more advanced language features including threads.
