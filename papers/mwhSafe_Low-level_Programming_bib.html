This brief note is an appendix to \emph{CMod: Modular
  Information Hiding and Type-Safe Linking for C} (Srivastava et al., June 2007).
It consists of the proof of soundness for the formal language presented in that paper.

  title = {Defining and Enforcing {C}'s Module System},
  author = {Saurabh Srivastava and Michael Hicks and Jeffrey S. Foster and Bhargav Kanagal},
  abstract = {
  Programming language module systems are an important tool for
  managing the complexity of large software systems.  The C
  programming language is used to build many such systems, yet it
  lacks a proper module system.  Instead, C programmers typically
  follow a convention that treats \texttt{.h} header files as
  interfaces and \texttt{.c} source files as modules.  This
  convention can be effective, but there are many subtleties in using
  it correctly, and the compiler and linker provide no enforcement
  mechanism.  As a result, misuse of the convention can lead to
  hard-to-find bugs, can make reasoning about code in isolation more
  difficult, and can complicate future code maintenance.

  This paper presents {\sc CMod}, a module system for C that ensures
  abstraction via information hiding and type-safe separate compilation.  Our
  approach is to identify and enforce the circumstances under
  which C's current modular programming convention is sound.  The result is
  four rules that, using an operational semantics for an
  idealized preprocessor, we have proven are sufficient to guarantee
  the desired modularity properties.  We have implemented {\sc CMod} for the
  full C language and applied it to a number of benchmarks.  We found
  that most of the time legacy programs obey {\sc CMod}'s rules, or can be
  made to with minimal effort, and rule violations often result in
  type errors or brittle code.  Thus {\sc CMod} brings the benefits of
  modular programming to C while still supporting
  legacy systems.
