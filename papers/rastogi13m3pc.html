  In a Secure Multi-party Computation (SMC), mutually-distrusting
  parties cooperate to compute over their private data; parties only
  learn information that is explicitly revealed as per the agreed
  protocol.  Standard implementations of SMC, e.g., using <em>garbled
  circuits</em>, can be very slow, so researchers have begun to explore
  what we call <em>mixed-mode</em> secure computations that combine
  standard SMCs with local computations, resulting in orders of
  magnitude speedups. Ultimately, we would like to produce a compiler
  that takes ``ordinary code'' and compiles it into mixed-mode
  SMC. As a step in this direction, this paper presents a core
  calculus that aims to capture the essence of mixed-mode SMCs, and
  their compilation to realizable protocols. Our approach builds on
  Levy's call-by-push-value calculus, and permits one to specify where
  a computation occurs, which computations are done locally versus
  securely, and also which state is carried over from one secure
  computation to another.  We show that a well-typed program in core
  calculus is sound (it does not get stuck), compiles properly to a target
  protocol, and that the operational semantics of the source program
  corresponds to the operational semantics of the target protocol.  We
  show that our framework is elegant, expressive, and practical by
  showing how it elucidates several recently published optimized
  protocols, and that it naturally supports reasoning about even more
  general compositions of such protocols.
