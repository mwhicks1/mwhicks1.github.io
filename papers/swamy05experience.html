 Special issue on memory management. Expands ISMM conference paper of

  The goal of the Cyclone project is to investigate how to make a
  low-level C-like language safe.  Our most difficult challenge has
  been providing programmers control over memory management while
  retaining safety.  This paper describes our experience trying
  to integrate and use effectively two previously-proposed, safe
  memory-management mechanisms: statically-scoped regions and tracked
  pointers.  We found that these typing mechanisms can be combined to
  build alternative memory-management abstractions, such as reference
  counted objects and arenas with dynamic lifetimes, and thus provide
  a flexible basis.  Our experience---porting C programs and device
  drivers, and building new applications for resource-constrained
  systems---confirms that experts can use these features to improve
  memory footprint and sometimes to improve throughput when used
  instead of, or in combination with, conservative garbage collection.
