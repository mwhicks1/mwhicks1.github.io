  abstract = {
A simple and effective way of coordinating distributed, mobile, and
parallel applications is to use a virtual shared memory (VSM), such as
a Linda tuple-space.  In this paper, we propose a new kind of VSM,
called a \emph{tagged set}.  Each element in the VSM is a value with
an associated tag, and values are read or removed from the VSM by
matching the tag.  Tagged sets exhibit three properties useful for
VSMs:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Ease of use}. A tagged value naturally corresponds to the
  notion that data has certain attributes, expressed by the tag, which
  can be used for later retrieval.

\item \emph{Flexibility}. Tags are implemented as propositional logic
  formulae, and selection as logical implication, so the resulting
  system is quite powerful.  Tagged sets naturally support a variety
  of applications, such as shared data repositories (e.g., for media
  or e-mail), message passing, and publish/subscribe algorithms;
  they are powerful enough to encode existing VSMs,
  such as Linda spaces.

\item \emph{Security}.  Our notion of tags naturally corresponds to
  keys, or capabilities: a user may not select data in the set unless
  she presents a legal key or keys.  Normal tags correspond to
  symmetric keys, and we introduce \emph{asymmetric tags} that
  correspond to public and private key pairs.  Treating tags as keys
  permits users to easily specify protection criteria for data at a
  fine granularity.
\end{enumerate}
This paper motivates our approach, sketches its basic theory, and
places it in the context of other data management strategies.

Most programming languages adopt static binding, but for distributed
programming an exclusive reliance on static binding is too
restrictive: dynamic binding is required in various guises.  Typically
it is provided only by ad-hoc mechanisms that lack clean semantics.
In this paper we adopt a more foundational approach, showing how core
dynamic rebinding mechanisms can be added to a CBV $\lambda$-calculus.
To do so we first develop two refinements of the CBV reduction
strategy with delayed instantiation, the \emph{redex-time} and
\emph{destruct-time} semantics.  Delayed instantiation ensures we
obtain the most recent version of a definition following a rebinding.
The destruct-time semantics gives the basis for a \lambda_{marsh} calculus
that supports dynamic rebinding, with primitives to package values and
\emph{marks} to control which identifiers are dynamically rebound when
they are unpackaged.  We extend \lambda_{marsh} with concurrency and
communication, giving examples showing how wrappers for encapsulating
untrusted code can be expressed, and discuss the extent to which it
can be statically typed.  Finally, we use the destruct-time semantics
also as a basis for a \lambda_{update} calculus with simple primitives to
provide type-safe, dynamic updating of code.  We thereby put a variety
of real-world mechanisms on a common semantic foundation.

  abstract = {
We describe a native-code implementation of Java that supports distributed
objects. In order to foster the correctness of distributed programs, remote
access is syntactically and semantically indistinguishable from local
access. This transparency is provided by the runtime system through the
implicit generation of remote references to an object when it is passed as
an argument or returned from a remote method call. Consistency is achieved
through the use of a distributed (and thus scalable) global addressing
scheme.  Experiments show that application performance is a function of data
layout, access algorithm, and local workload. For distributed applications,
such as distributed databases, these factors may not be known statically,
suggesting the importance of runtime support.
