  Location-based services, which employ data from
  smartphones, vehicles, etc., are growing in popularity.  
  To reduce the threat that shared location data poses to a user's
  privacy, some services anonymize or obfuscate this data.
  In this paper, we show these methods can be effectively defeated: a
  set of location traces can be deanonymized given an easily
  obtained social network graph.
  The key idea of our approach is that a user may be identified by those she
  meets: a <em>contact graph</em> identifying meetings between
  anonymized users in a set of traces can be structurally correlated
  with a social network graph, thereby identifying anonymized
  users. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using three
  real world datasets: University of St Andrews mobility trace and
  social network (27 nodes each), SmallBlue contact trace and Facebook
  social network (125 nodes), and Infocom 2006 bluetooth contact
  traces and conference attendees' DBLP social network (78 nodes). Our
  experiments show that 80% of users are identified
  precisely, while only 8% are identified incorrectly, with the
  remainder mapped to a small set of users.
