  Monads are a popular tool for the working functional programmer to
  structure effectful computations. This paper presents
  <em>polymonads</em>, a generalization of monads. Polymonads give the
  familiar monadic bind the more general type 
  for all<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>. <em>L</em> <em>a</em> -&gt;(<em>a</em> -&gt;<em>M</em> <em>b</em>) -&gt;<em>N</em> <em>b</em>, to
  compose computations with three different kinds of effects, rather
  than just one. Polymonads subsume monads and parameterized monads,
  and can express other constructions, including precise
  type-and-effect systems and information flow tracking; more
  generally, polymonads correspond to Tate's <em>productoid</em>
  semantic model. We show how to equip a core language (called &lambda;<sub>PM</sub>)
  with syntactic support for programming with polymonads. Type
  inference and elaboration in &lambda;<sub>PM</sub> allows programmers to write
  polymonadic code directly in an ML-like syntax---our algorithms
  compute principal types and produce elaborated programs wherein
  the binds appear explicitly. Furthermore, we prove that the
  elaboration is <em>coherent</em>: no matter which (type-correct) binds
  are chosen, the elaborated program's semantics will be the
  same. Pleasingly, the inferred types are easy to read: the polymonad
  laws justify (sometimes dramatic) simplifications, but with no
  effect on a type's generality.<p>
