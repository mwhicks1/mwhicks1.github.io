At the University of Maryland, we have been working to improve the
reliability and security of software by developing new, effective
static analysis tools.  These tools scan software for bug patterns
or show that the software is free from a particular class of defects.
There are two themes common to our different projects:
<p><ol>
Our ultimate focus is on <em>utility</em>: can a programmer
  actually improve the quality of his or her software using an analysis tool?
  The important first step toward answering this question is to
  engineer tools so that they can analyze existing, nontrivial
  programs, and to carefully report the results of such analyses
  experimentally.  The desire to better understand a more
  human-centered notion of utility underlies much of our
  future work.
We release all of our tools open
  source (<a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/PL/">http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/PL/</a>).
  This
  allows other researchers to verify our results, and to reuse some or
  all of our implementations, which often required significant
  effort to engineer.  We believe that
  releasing source code is important for accelerating the pace of
  research results software quality, and just as importantly allows
  feedback from the wider community.

In this research group presentation, we summarize some recent work
and sketch future directions.
