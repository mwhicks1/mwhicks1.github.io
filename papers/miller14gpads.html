  An authenticated data structure (ADS) is a data structure whose
  operations can be carried out by an untrusted <em>prover</em>, the
  results of which a <em>verifier</em> can efficiently check as
  authentic. This is done by having the prover produce a compact proof
  that the verifier can check along with each operation's result.  ADSs thus
  support outsourcing data maintenance and processing tasks to
  untrusted servers without loss of integrity. Past work on ADSs has
  focused on particular data structures (or limited classes of data
  structures), one at a time, often with support only for particular
  operations.<p>
This paper presents a generic method, using a simple
  extension to a ML-like functional programming language we call LambdaAuth,
  with which one can program authenticated operations
  over any data structure defined by standard type constructors,
  including recursive types, sums, and products. The programmer writes
  the data structure largely as usual and it is compiled to code
  to be run by the prover and verifier. Using a formalization of LambdaAuth
  we prove that all well-typed LambdaAuth programs result in code that is
  secure under the standard cryptographic assumption of
  collision-resistant hash functions. We have implemented LambdaAuth
  as an extension to the OCaml compiler, and have used it to produce
  authenticated versions of many interesting data structures including
  binary search trees, red-black+ trees, skip lists, and
  more. Performance experiments show that our approach is efficient,
  giving up little compared to the hand-optimized data structures
  developed previously.
