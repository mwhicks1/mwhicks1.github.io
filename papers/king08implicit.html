Verifying that programs trusted to enforce security actually do so is
a practical concern for programmers and administrators.  However, there is a
disconnect between the kinds of tools that have been successfully applied to real
software systems (such as taint mode in Perl and Ruby), and information-flow
compilers that enforce a variant of the stronger security property of
noninterference.  Tools that have been successfully used to find security
violations have focused on <i>explicit flows</i> of information, where
high-security information is directly leaked to output.  Analysis tools that
enforce noninterference also prevent <i>implicit flows</i> of
information, where high-security information can be inferred from a program's
flow of control.  However, these tools have seen little use in
practice, despite the stronger guarantees that they provide.  <p>
To better understand why, this paper experimentally investigates
the explicit and implicit flows identified by the standard
algorithm for establishing noninterference.  When applied to
implementations of authentication and cryptographic functions, the
standard algorithm discovers many real implicit flows of
information, but also reports an extremely high number of false alarms,
most of which are due to conservative handling of unchecked
exceptions (e.g., null pointer exceptions).  After a careful
analysis of all sources of 
true and false alarms, due to both implicit and explicit flows, the
paper concludes with some ideas to improve the false alarm rate,
toward making stronger security analysis more practical.
