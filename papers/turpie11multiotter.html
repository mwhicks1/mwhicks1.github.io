  Symbolic execution can be an effective technique for exploring large numbers
  of program paths, but it has generally been applied to programs running in
  isolation, whose inputs are files or command-line arguments. Programs that
  take inputs from other programs---servers, for example---have been
  beyond the reach of symbolic execution. To address this, we developed a
  multiprocess symbolic
  executor called MultiOtter, along with an implementation of many of the POSIX functions, such as
  <tt>socket</tt> and <tt>select</tt>, that interactive programs usually rely on.
  However, that is just a first step. Next, we must determine what symbolic inputs
  to feed to an interactive program to make multiprocess symbolic execution effective.
  Providing completely unconstrained symbolic values causes symbolic execution
  to spend too much time exploring uninteresting paths, such as paths to handle
  invalid inputs. MultiOtter allows us to generate inputs that conform to a
  context-free grammar, similar to previous work, but it also enables new input
  generation capabilities because we can now run arbitrary programs concurrently
  with the program being studied. As examples, we symbolically executed a
  key-value store server, redis, and an FTP server, vsftpd, each with a variety
  of inputs, including symbolic versions of tests from redis's test suite
  and wget as a client for vsftpd. We report the coverage provided by symbolic
  execution with various forms of symbolic input, showing that different testing
  goals require different degrees of symbolic inputs.
